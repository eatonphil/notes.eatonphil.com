#Unit testing C code with gtest
## August 31, 2019
###### c,cmake,ctest,testing

I've got a few projects in C now (for network programming and/or in
search of a challenge) but it has taken a while to find an easy,
minimal unit testing setup. I finally got around to a working setup
using [Google's gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for a
work-in-progress [JavaScript
interpreter](https://github.com/eatonphil/slowjs). I'm writing about
this setup to use as a foundation for a few more projects I'll be
writing about soon.

<p class="note">
  The first version of this post only included one library to
  test. The <code>test/CMakeLists.txt</code> would also only expose a
  single pass-fail status for all libraries. The second version of
  this post extends the <code>test/CMakeLists.txt</code> to expose
  each <code>test/*.cpp</code> file as its own CMake test so that
  results are displayed by <code>ctest</code> per file. The second
  version also splits the original <code>src/testy.c</code>
  and <code>include/testy/testy.h</code> module into
  a <code>widget</code> and <code>customer</code> module to
  demonstrate the changes to the CMake configuration.

### The "testy" sample project

In this project, we'll put source code in `src/` and publicly
exported symbols (functions, structs, etc.) in header files in
`include/testy/`. There will be a `main.c` in the `src/`
directory. Tests are written in C++ (since gtest is a C++ testing
framework) and are in the `test/` directory.

Here's an overview of the source and test code.

#### src/widget.c

This file has some library code that we should be able to test.

```c
#include "testy/widget.h"

int private_ok_value = 2;

int widget_ok(int a, int b) {
  return a + b == private_ok_value;
}
```

#### include/testy/widget.h

This file handles exported symbols for widget code.

```c
#ifndef _WIDGET_H_
#define _WIDGET_H_

int widget_ok(int, int);

#endif
```

#### src/customer.c

This file has some more library code that we should be able to test.

```c
#include "testy/customer.h"

int customer_check(int a) {
  return a == 5;
}
```

#### include/testy/customer.h

This file handles exported symbols for customer code.

```c
#ifndef _CUSTOMER_H_
#define _CUSTOMER_H_

int customer_check(int);

#endif
```

#### src/main.c

This is the entrypoint to a program built around libtesty.

```c
#include "testy/customer.h"
#include "testy/widget.h"

int main() {
  if (widget_ok(1, 1)) {
    return customer_check(5);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

#### test/widget.cpp

This is one of our test files. It registers test cases and uses gtest
to make assertions. We need to wrap the `testy/widget.h` include in an
`extern "C"` to stop C++ from
[name-mangling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/extern-c-in-c/).

```cpp
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

extern "C" {
#include "testy/widget.h"
}

TEST(widget, ok) {
  ASSERT_EQ(widget_ok(1, 1), 1);
}

TEST(testy, not_ok) {
  ASSERT_EQ(widget_ok(1, 2), 0);
}
```

You can see a good high-level overview of gtest testing utilities like
`ASSERT_EQ` and `TEST`
[here](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md).


#### test/customer.cpp

This is another one of our test files.

```cpp
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

extern "C" {
#include "testy/customer.h"
}

TEST(customer, ok) {
  ASSERT_EQ(customer_check(5), 1);
}

TEST(testy, not_ok) {
  ASSERT_EQ(customer_check(0), 0);  
}
```

#### test/main.cpp

This is a standard entrypoint for the test runner.

```cpp
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Building with CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org) is a build tool that (among other things)
produces a Makefile we can run to build our code. We will also use it
for dependency management. But fundementally we use it because gtest
requires it.

CMake options/rules are defined in a CMakeLists.txt file. We'll have
one in the root directory, one in the test directory, and a template
for one that will handle the gtest dependency.

A first draft of the top-level CMakeLists.txt might look like this:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)

project(testy)

##
### Source definitions ###
##

include_directories("${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include")

file(GLOB sources "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.c")

add_executable(testy ${sources})
```

Using `include_directory` will make sure we compile with the `-I` flag
set up correctly for our include directory.

Using `add_executable` sets up the binary name to produce from the
given sources. And we're using the `file` helper to get a glob match
of C files rather than listing them all out verbatim in the
`add_executable` call.

#### Building and running

CMake pollutes the current directory, and is fine running in a
different directory, so we'll make a `build/` directory so we don't
pollute root. Then we'll build a Makefile with CMake, run Make, and
run our program.

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
-- The C compiler identification is AppleClang 10.0.1.10010046
-- The CXX compiler identification is AppleClang 10.0.1.10010046

$ make

[ 75%] Building C object CMakeFiles/testy.dir/src/main.c.o
[100%] Linking C executable testy
[100%] Built target testy
$ ./testy
$ echo $?
1
```

### CMakeLists.txt.in

This template file handles downloading the gtest dependency from
github.com pinned to a release. It will be copied into a subdirectory
during the `cmake ..` step.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)

project(googletest-download NONE)

include(ExternalProject)
ExternalProject_Add(googletest
  GIT_REPOSITORY    https://github.com/google/googletest.git
  GIT_TAG           release-1.8.1
  SOURCE_DIR        "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/googletest-src"
  BINARY_DIR        "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/googletest-build"
  CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
  BUILD_COMMAND     ""
  INSTALL_COMMAND   ""
  TEST_COMMAND      ""
)
```

Now we can tell CMake about it and how to build, within the top-level
CMakeLists.txt file.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)

project(testy)

##
### Test definitions ###
##

configure_file(CMakeLists.txt.in
        googletest-download/CMakeLists.txt)
execute_process(COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -G "${CMAKE_GENERATOR}" .
        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/googletest-download )
execute_process(COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --build .
        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/googletest-download )

add_subdirectory(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/googletest-src
        ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/googletest-build)

enable_testing()
add_subdirectory(test)

##
### Source definitions ###
##

include_directories("${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include")

file(GLOB sources
  "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/testy/*.h"
  "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.c")

add_executable(testy ${sources})
```

The `add_subdirectory` calls register a directory that contains its
own CMakeLists.txt. It would fail now without a `CMakeLists.txt` file
in the `test/` directory.

### test/CMakeLists.txt

This final file registers a `unit_test` executable compiling against
the source and test code, and includes the project header files.

```cmake
include_directories("${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include")

file(GLOB sources "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.c")
list(REMOVE_ITEM sources "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main.c")

file(GLOB tests "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/test/*.cpp")
list(REMOVE_ITEM tests "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/test/main.cpp")

foreach(file ${tests})
  set(name)
  get_filename_component(name ${file} NAME_WE)
  add_executable("${name}_tests"
    ${sources}
    ${file}
    "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/test/main.cpp")
  target_link_libraries("${name}_tests" gtest_main)
  add_test(NAME ${name} COMMAND "${name}_tests")
endforeach()
```

We have to register a test for each file otherwise each file's tests
won't show up by default (i.e. without a `--verbose` flag).

#### Building and running tests

Similar to building and running the source, we run CMake in a
subdirectory but run `make test` or `ctest` after building all sources
and tests with `make`.

```bash
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

```

After running `cmake` and `make`, we're finally ready to run `ctest`.

```bash
$ ctest
Test project /Users/philipeaton/tmp/testy/build
    Start 1: customer
1/2 Test #1: customer ..........................   Passed    0.01 sec
    Start 2: widget
2/2 Test #2: widget ............................   Passed    0.00 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 2

Total Test time (real) =   0.01 sec
```

Now we're in a good place with most of the challenges of unit testing
C code (i.e. ignoring mocks) past us.
