# Confusion and disengagement in meetings
## November 30, 2019

The quickest way to cut through confusion or disagreement among
otherwise amiable and honest folks is to ask questions.

Ask early so you don't waste time. But it's not enough to just ask
clarifying questions because the **answers** won't always be clear.

Sounds like Human Interaction 101, and maybe it is. These techniques
show up more when discussing **outcomes** and very rarely when
discussing **assumptions**.

Meetings are called to discuss outcomes, not assumptions. But
assumptions almost always need to be called into question too.

If you have clarity personally but you observe confusion and
disengagement, **ask questions and summarize**. Someone must be aware
of the group and be willing to sound dumb.

If you aren't aware of confusion or disengagement, start paying
attention. Addressing doesn't need to be hard and is personally
meaningful.
