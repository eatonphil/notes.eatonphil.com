# Windows
## January 20, 2019

It has been six years since I last used Windows for any remotely
serious software development. I've used Ubuntu, Arch, or FreeBSD
since. But eventually I spent so much time working around common
workplace tasks that I decided to put Windows 10 Pro on my work
laptop.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Introduced in 2016, this technology allows Windows to run unmodified
Linux binaries. The core feat being [syscall
translation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/06/08/wsl-system-calls/).

It works nearly flawlessly. This means I can do all my Go, Node,
PostgreSQL development on Windows without a virtual machine using
bash, tmux, git, emacs, etc.

I've seen a few minor exceptions over the course of regular software
development in WSL:

* [ss/netstat does not work](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2249)
* [vagrant does not work](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8700)

More generally, Linux programs are heavily file-oriented. And Windows
I/O [is not designed well for
that](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/873#issuecomment-425272829).
In the worst cases (installing/adding Node packages) it can take
minutes to do operations that would take Linux seconds.

### Vagrant

Vagrant-Windows interoperability is abysmal.

As noted above, you cannot manage Hyper-V from vagrant within WSL. So
you're stuck using Powershell. Even then, managing synced files from
vagrant is a nightmare. The default sync method requires you to sign
in using your **Windows Live** username and password on every
reboot. But Node package installation attempts some file operations
that are not supported over the default synced, network filesystem.

When I switched to rsync vagrant wouldn't reliable sync when the
virtual machine went down and came back up.

After hours of trying to get some files synced with vagrant I gave up.

### Hyper-V

Hyper-V's GUI is much more complex/feature-complete than VirtualBox.
It even provides a Ubuntu-quick-install that I used to jump right in.
I don't recommend using this though because it gives you no option but
an 11GB hard disk. I didn't realize this until I went through an hour
or two of post-install customization only to run out of space. Too
lazy to boot into a live CD to grow the root filesystem I reinstalled
with a more suitable 64GB drive and went through the hour-long
post-install customization process again.

Networking in Hyper-V is more complex/feature-complete than VirtualBox
as well. To access a Hyper-V machine you must create a new virtual
network interface manually and associate it. Static IP address appear
to be controlled at the host networking level (e.g. Control Panel)
instead of within the Hyper-V interface. This highlights how these
virtual interfaces are first-class, but overcomplicates the process of
getting started.

Ultimately I gave up on a static IP address and decided to reboot less
frequently.

Performance-wise Hyper-V machines are exactly as expected: excellent.

### Misc

Docker support on Windows needs work. It took me a while to understand
how Docker interacts with the WSL filesystem and what I needed to do
to allow Docker to mount. The complexity is similar on macOS when you
want to mount privileged directories like /var, but the experience is
worse on Windows.

Apparently Windows does have tiling window managers, but I have not
tried one out yet.

Powershell, a language with real types, is pretty compelling. But I
have not spent enough time with it to be efficient. And since WSL is
mostly good enough I don't really plan to.

Windows doesn't allow you to delete any files that are "in use". This
is kinda cool except for that the errors you get when trying to delete
files that are in use are useless. They are even more useless when you
get the plain "could not delete directory" when you try to delete a
directory with some file inside it that is in use. I had to start
deleting files within by hand until I found the one I realized was in
use.

### Conclusion

If you have never run Linux or FreeBSD, don't use this post as an
excuse not to. You should run Linux or FreeBSD for the experience. But
if you've reached diminishing returns in your Linux/FreeBSD use,
Windows as a development environment has come a long way. It may be
the best platform available for software development, the profession.
