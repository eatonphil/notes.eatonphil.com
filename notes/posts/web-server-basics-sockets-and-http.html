# Web server basics (1): sockets and HTTP
## April 6, 2019

Say we have some HTML:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

And say we'd like to be able to render this page in a web browser. If
the server is hosted locally we may want to enter
<code>localhost:9000/hello-world.html</code> in the address bar, hit
enter, make a request (done by the browser), receive a response (sent
by some server), and render the result (done by the browser).

Here is a minimal Node.js program (<100LoC) that would serve this up:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const net = require('net');

const CRLF = '\r\n';

const HELLO_WORLD = `<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>`;
const NOT_FOUND = `<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Not found</h1>
  </body>
</html>`;

class HTTPRequestHandler {
  constructor(connection) {
    this.connection = connection;
    this.request = {
      statusLine: null,
      headers: {},
      body: null,
    };
  }

  parse(buffer) {
    const lines = buffer.toString().split(CRLF);

    // Parse/store status line if necessary
    if (!this.request.statusLine) {
      const [method, path, protocol] = lines.shift().split(' ');
      this.request.statusLine = { method, path, protocol };
    }

    // Parse/store headers if the body hasn't begun
    if (!this.request.body) {
      for (let line = lines.shift(); lines.length; line = lines.shift()) {
        // Reached the end of headers, double CRLF
        if (line === '') {
          this.request.body = '';
          break;
        }

        const [key, value] = line.split(':');

        const safeKey = key.toLowerCase();
        if (!this.request.headers[safeKey]) {
          this.request.headers[safeKey] = [];
        }

        this.request.headers[safeKey].push(value.trimStart());
      }
    }

    this.request.body += lines.join(CRLF);
  }
  
  requestComplete() {
    if (!this.request.statusLine || !Object.keys(this.request.headers).length || this.request.body === null) {
      // Incomplete request
      return false;
    }

    const [contentLength] = this.request.headers['content-length'] || [];
    if (this.request.statusLine.method !== 'GET' && this.request.body.length !== contentLength) {
      // Incomplete request
      return false;
    }
    
    return true;
  }
  
  sendResponse() {
    if (this.request.statusLine.path === '/hello-world.html') {
      this.connection.write(`HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: ${HELLO_WORLD.length}\r\n\r\n${HELLO_WORLD}`);
    } else {
      this.connection.write(`HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\r\nContent-Length: ${NOT_FOUND.length}\r\n\r\n${NOT_FOUND}`);
    }
  }

  handle(buffer) {
    this.parse(buffer);

    if (!this.requestComplete()) {
      return;
    }
  
    this.sendResponse();

    // Other-wise the connection may attempt to be re-used, we don't support this.
    this.connection.end();
  }
}

function handleConnection(connection) {
  const handler = new HTTPRequestHandler(connection);
  connection.on('data', (buffer) => handler.handle(buffer));
}

const server = net.createServer(handleConnection);

server.listen('9000');
```

So what's going on?

### The protocol

HTTP (version 1.1, specifically) is a convention for connecting over
TCP/IP and sending plain-text messages between two processes. HTTP
messages are broken into two categories: requests (the sender of a
request is called a "client") and responses (the sender of a response
is called a "server").

HTTP is important because it is the default protocol of web
browsers. When we type in <code>localhost:9000/hello-world.html</code>
and hit enter, the browser will open an TCP/IP connection to the
location <code>localhost</code> on the port <code>9000</code> and send
an HTTP request. If/when it receives the HTTP response from the server
it will try to render the response.

#### An HTTP request

A bare minimum HTTP/1.1 request ([defined
here](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html)) based
on the request for <code>localhost:9000/hello-world.html</code> is the
following:

```text
GET /hello-world.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:9000\r\n\r\n
```

NOTE: the spec explicitly requires the <code>\r\n</code> combo to
represent a newline instead of simply <code>\n</code>.

If we printed out this request it would look like this:

```text
GET /hello-world.html HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9000

```

#### Components of an HTTP request

An HTTP/1.1 request is made up of a few parts:

* [Mandatory]: The status line (the first line) followed by a CRLF (the <code>\r\n</code> combo)
* [Mandatory]: HTTP headers separated by a CRLF and followed by an additional CRLF
* [Optional]: The request body

The status line consists of the request method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT,
etc.), the path for the request, and the protocol -- all separated by
a space.

An HTTP header is a key-value pair separated by a colon. Spaces
following the colon are ignored. The key is case insensitive. Only
the <code>Host</code> header appears to be mandatory. Since these
headers are sent by the client they are intended for the server's use.

The request body is text and is only relevant for requests of certain
methods (e.g. POST but not GET).

#### An HTTP response

A bare minimum HTTP/1.1 response ([defined
here](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html)) based
on the file we wanted to send back is the following:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello world!</h1>\n  </body>\n</html>
```

If we printed out this response it would look like this:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Components of an HTTP response

An HTTP/1.1 response is made up of a few parts:

* [Mandatory]: The status line (the first line) followed by a CRLF
* [Optional]: HTTP headers separated by a CRLF and followed by an additional CRLF
* [Optional]: The request body

The status line consists of the protocol, the status code, and the
status message -- all separated by a space.

HTTP response headers are the same as HTTP request headers although in
a response they are directives from the server to the client. There
are many [standard
headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html) that
are used for such things as setting cache rules, setting cookies,
settings response type (e.g. HTML vs CSS vs PNG so the browser knows
how to handle the response).

The response body is similar to the HTTP request body.

### Sockets and ports

Most operating systems have a built-in means of connecting over TCP/IP
(and sending and receiving messages) called "sockets". Most
programming languages have a built-in socket library. Node.js provides
a high-level interface for listening on a port and handling new
connections.

```javascript
function handleConnection(connection) {
  connection.on('data', (buffer) => doSomething???);
}

const server = net.createServer(handleConnection);

server.listen('9000');
```

Once the program is listening, clients can open TCP/IP connections to
the address (<code>localhost</code>) port (<code>9000</code>) and our
program takes over from there. Each connection is handled separately
and receives "data" events. Each data event represents new bytes
available for us to handle.

Let's encapsulate the state of each connection in HTTPRequestHandler
class. It's function will be to parse data as it becomes available and
respond to the request when the request is done.

```javascript
class HTTPRequestHandler {
  constructor(connection) {
    this.connection = connection;
  }
  
  parse(buffer) {}
  
  requestComplete() {}
  
  sendResponse() {}

  handle(buffer) {
    this.parse(buffer);
    
    if (!this.requestComplete()) {
      return;
    }
    
    this.sendResponse();
        
    // Other-wise the connection may attempt to be re-used, we don't support this.
    this.connection.end();
  }
}

function handleConnection(connection) {
  const handler = new HTTPRequestHandler(connection);
  connection.on('data', (buffer) => handler.handle(buffer));
}

...
```
