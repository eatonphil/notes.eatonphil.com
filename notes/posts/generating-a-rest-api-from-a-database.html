# Generating a REST API from a database

I recently published an [alpha version of a code generation tool,
DBCore,](https://eatonphil.github.io/dbcore/) that reads a database
schema from PostgreSQL or MySQL and generates an entire Go API with
CRUD operations, pagination, filtering, and authentication.

But more than just generating code like
[xo/xo](https://github.com/xo/xo) or [gnorm](https://gnorm.org/),
DBCore defines a standard REST API that can be implemented in any
language -- and includes a reference implementation in Go. I'm eager
to add Java and Ruby implementations as well. And I'd be more than
happy to accept community contributions.

### Boilerplate & code generation

Web application boilerplate is boring. You should do it once from
scratch (preferably down to the socket layer) and never do it again. I
struggled for the last few years to find the right system to reduce
boilerplate. If I were building a new line-of-business application as
an employee I'd pick one of Rails, ASP.NET, Spring, Django, or
similar.

But I've never worked on one of those frameworks professionally and
I've never been able to force myself to learn any of them in my free
time.

Over the last few years though I've relied heavily on code generation
for Go projects. Code generation is basically the only way to conserve
type-safe code in Go. But it's similarly
[popular](https://www.jooq.org/doc/3.13/manual/code-generation/) in
more powerful languages like Java.

### DBCore

DBCore is written in F# and can be distributed as a static
binary on all systems .NET now supports (read: not just Windows!).

As mentioned, currently DBCore only provides a Go REST API
template. But the next big step is to provide a template for
generating a browser application that can integrate according to the
DBCore API specification.

Finally, while the tool only currently has a concept of "browser" and
"api" templates, the project should be able to accept any kind of
template and generate any text based on any database schema.
