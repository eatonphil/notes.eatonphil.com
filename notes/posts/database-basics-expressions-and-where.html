In this post, we'll extend [gosql](https://github.com/eatonphil/gosql)
to support binary expressions and very simple filtering on SELECT
results via WHERE. We'll introduce a general mechanism for
interpreting an expression on a row in a table. The expression may be
an identifier (where the result is the value of the cell corresponding
to that column in the row), a numeric literal, a combination via a
binary expression, etc.

The following interactions will be possible:

```sql
# CREATE TABLE users (name TEXT, age INT);
ok
#  INSERT INTO users VALUES ('Stephen', 16);
ok
# SELECT name, age FROM users;
name   | age
----------+------
Stephen |  16
(1 result)
ok
# INSERT INTO users VALUES ('Adrienne', 23);
ok
# SELECT age + 2, name FROM users WHERE age = 23;
age |   name
------+-----------
25 | Adrienne
(1 result)
ok
# SELECT name FROM users;
name
------------
Stephen
Adrienne
(2 results)
ok
```

The changes we'll make in this post are roughly a walk through of
[this
commit](https://github.com/eatonphil/gosql/commit/bd6a5d0d4a7410699b0d01beaabf91923df34b28).
