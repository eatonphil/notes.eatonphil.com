# btest: a language agnostic test runner
## August 4, 2018

[btest](https://github.com/briansteffens/btest) is a minimal,
language-agnostic test runner originally written for testing
compilers. Brian, an ex- co-worker from Linode, wrote the first
implementation in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) (a compiled
language clone of Ruby) for testing
[bshift](https://github.com/briansteffens/bshift), a compiler
project. The tool accomplished exactly what I needed for my own
language project, [BSDScheme](https://github.com/eatonphil/bsdscheme),
and had very few dependencies. After some issues with Crystal support
in containerized CI environments, and despite some incredible
[assistance from](https://github.com/briansteffens/btest/pull/5) [the
Crystal community](https://github.com/briansteffens/btest/pull/4), we
rewrote btest in D to simplify downstream use.

### How it works

btest registers a command (or commands) to run and verifies the
command output and status for different inputs. btest iterates over
files in a directory to discover test groups and individual tests
within. It supports a limited template language for easily adjusting a
more-or-less similar set of tests. And it supports running test groups
and individual tests themselves in parallel. All of this is managed
via a simple YAML config.

### btest.yaml

btest requires a project-level configuration file to declare the test
directory, the command(s) to run per test, etc. Let's say we want to
run tests against a python program. We create
a <code>btest.yaml</code> file with the following:

```yaml
test_path: tests

runners:
  - name: Run tests with cpython
    run: python test.py
```

<code>test_path</code> is the directory in which tests are located.
<code>runners</code> is an array of commands to run per test. We
hard-code a file to run <code>test.py</code> as a project-level
standard file that will get written to disk in an appropriate path for
each test-case.

#### On multiple runners

Using multiple runners is helpful when we want to run all tests with
different test commands or test command settings. For instance, we
could run tests against cpython and pypy by adding another runner to
the runners section.

```yaml
test_path: tests

runners:
  - name: Run tests with cpython
    run: python test.py
  - name: Run tests with pypy
    run: pypy test.py
```

### An example test config

Let's create a <code>divide-by-zero.yaml</code> file in
the <code>tests</code> directory and add the following:

```yaml
cases:
  - name: Should exit on divide by zero
    status: 1
    stdout: |
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "test.py", line 1, in <module>
          4 / 0
      ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
    denominator: 0
templates:
  - test.py: |
      4 / {{ denominator }}
```

In this example, <code>name</code> will be printed out when the test
is run. <code>status</code> is the expected integer returned by
running the program. <code>stdout</code> is the entire expected output
written by the program during execution. None of these three fields
are required. If <code>status</code> or <case>stdout</case> are not
provided, btest will skip checking them.

Any additional key-value pairs are treated as template variable values
and will be substituted if/where it is referenced in the templates
section when the case is run. <code>denominator</code> is the only
such variable we use in this example. When this first (and only) case
is run, <code>test.py</code> will be written to disk
containing <code>4 / 0</code>.

#### templates section

The <code>templates</code> section is a dictionary allowing us to
specify files to be created with variable substitution. All files are
created in the same directory per test case, so if we want to import
code we can do so with relative paths.

[Here](https://github.com/eatonphil/bsdscheme/blob/master/tests/include.yaml)
is a simple example of a BSDScheme test that uses this feature.

### Running btest

Run btest from the root directory (the directory
above <code>tests</code>) and we'll see all the grouped test cases
that btest registers and the result of each test:

```
$ btest
tests/divide-by-zero.yaml
[PASS] Should exit on divide by zero

1 of 1 tests passed for runner: Run tests with cpython
```

### Use in CI environments

In the future we may provide pre-built release binaries. But in the
meantime, the CI step involves downloading git and ldc and
building/installing btest before calling it.

#### Circle CI

This is the
[config](https://github.com/eatonphil/bsdscheme/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)
file I use for testing BSDScheme:

```
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: dlanguage/ldc
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install debian-packaged dependencies
          command: |
            apt update
            apt install -y git build-essential
            ln -s $(which ldc2) /usr/local/bin/ldc
      - run:
          name: Install btest
          command: |
            git clone https://github.com/briansteffens/btest
            cd btest
            make
            make install
      - run:
          name: Install bsdscheme
          command: |
            make
            make install
      - run:
          name: Run bsdscheme tests
          command: btest
```

#### Travis CI

This is the
[config](https://github.com/briansteffens/bshift/blob/master/.travis.yml)
Brian uses for testing BShift:

```
sudo: required

language: d

d:
    - ldc

script:
    # ldc gets installed as other names sometimes
    - sudo ln -s `which $DC` /usr/local/bin/ldc

    # bshift
    - make
    - sudo ln -s $PWD/bin/bshift /usr/local/bin/bshift
    - sudo ln -s $PWD/lib /usr/local/lib/bshift

    # nasm
    - sudo apt-get install -y nasm

    # basm
    - git clone https://github.com/briansteffens/basm
    - cd basm && cabal build && cd ..
    - sudo ln -s $PWD/basm/dist/build/basm/basm /usr/local/bin/basm

    # btest
    - git clone https://github.com/briansteffens/btest
    - cd btest && make && sudo make install && cd ..

    # run the tests
    - btest
```
