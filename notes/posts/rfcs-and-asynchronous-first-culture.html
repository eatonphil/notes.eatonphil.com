# RFCs and asynchronous-first culture

I hated writing documentation before working on features. But after a
while I realized I couldn't communicate well enough even with folks I
had a good connection with. It took me a number of mistaken deliveries
to get the message.

Designers solve this by producing low-fidelity sketches early on in
the process, building up only after feedback to a high-fidelity
mockup. I solved this on my teams by producing short RFC (request for
comment) documents. This isn't an original idea, but I see it so
rarely I wanted to share.

Now when I begin thinking about an organizational or technical change,
I write an RFC. They are typically a page or two long and typically
take me 30-60 minutes to get a good first draft. I make clear in the
title that it is a proposal or draft. This allows me to make crazy
suggestions without upsetting folks; a draft can be easily thrown
away.

My RFCs include three parts:
1. What I think the problem is
1. Pros/cons of all the solutions I considered
1. Which solution I'm planning to go with if no one responds to the RFC

After I write the first draft I circulate among a small group of peers
I respect, my boss, etc. I request feedback at leisure and I check in
every few days with a reminder. If no one responds after a while and
there is little concern, I'll typically go ahead with the proposed
solution.

In addition to clarifying intent up front, this removes the need to
schedule a meeting to discuss a problem. Discussion and decisions can
be held asynchronously. I only schedule a meeting if there is
disagreement that is unable to be resolved in writing.

After incorporating feedback, I'll either throw away the RFC and move
on or I'll send it out to the wider group of all affected
participants. At this point I can feel reasonably confident about the
problem and solutions. Any final meetings can be held as needed.

### Asynchronous-first communication

Synchronous-first and undocumented proposals make some sense when
you've got a small team in the same office/timezone with a similar
schedule. Otherwise, you repeatedly reschedule meetings to accommodate
timezones and schedules. Without asynchronous RFCs you spend your
first few meetings just coming to understand and agree on <em>the
problem</em>. Without documenting anything, you can't be sure on what
the problem is or what you agreed on.

I don't find the 30-60 minutes to write a page or two of a proposal
and a possible follow-up meeting to be worse than the otherwise
guarenteed scheduling and rescheduling multiple meetings to discuss
and solve a problem. I ask my team to do the same.
