# RFCs and asynchronous-first culture

I hated writing documentation before working on features. But after a
while I realized I couldn't communicate well enough, even with folks I
had a good connection with. It took me a number of mistaken deliveries
to get the message.

### Sketches and mockups

Designers solve this by producing low-fidelity sketches early on in
the process, iterating on feedback to produce a high-fidelity
mockup. I solve this by producing short RFC (request for comment)
documents. This isn't an original idea, but I see it so rarely I
wanted to share.

Now as soon as I begin thinking about a technical or organizational
change, I write an RFC. My RFCs are typically a page or two long and
typically take me 30-60 minutes for a good first draft. I make
clear in the title that it is a proposal or draft. This allows me to
make crazy suggestions without upsetting folks; a draft can be easily
thrown away.

### RFC process

My RFCs include three key sections:
1. What I think the problem is
1. Pros/cons of all the solutions I considered
1. Which solution I'm planning to go with if no one responds to the RFC

After I write the first draft I circulate it among a small group of peers
I respect, my boss, etc. I request feedback at leisure and I check in
every few days with a reminder. If no one responds after a while and
there is little concern, I typically move forward with the proposed
solution.

In addition to clarifying intent up front, this removes the need to
schedule a meeting to <em>discuss a problem</em>. Discussion and
decisions can be held asynchronously. I only schedule a meeting if
there is disagreement that is unable to be resolved in writing.

After incorporating feedback, I either throw away the RFC and move on
or feel reasonably confident about the proposal. I send it out to a
wider group of relevant participants. Final meetings are held as
needed.

### The other option

In contrast, synchronous-first and undocumented proposals make some
sense when you've got a small team in the same timezone with a similar
schedule. Otherwise, you repeatedly reschedule meetings to accommodate
everyone. You spend your first few meetings simply coming to
understand and agree on <em>the problem</em>.

Spending 30-60 minutes to draft a proposal is almost always easier. It
has been an advantage for my teams and I.
