# Writing to be read
## May 18, 2018

There is a constant fight when writing documentation, checklists,
emails, guides, etc. in the context of work. Each of these provides
immense value and can be the key to a particular process.  The fight
is in doing whatever possible to remove barriers for others to better
understand and ultimately correctly apply what has been written. Aside
from clarity on the content of writing, there are particular aesthetic
"heuristics" I use to make notes seem more approachable.

### Language correctness

The low-hanging fruit is spelling and grammatical correctness. It is
not difficult to provide.

### Layout and spacing

My standards in this category are heavily influence by On Writing Well.

#### On content

1.  Use full sentences

2. Don't use more words than you need

3. Don't use long sentences

It is easy to write run-on sentences. They are difficult to parse.

4. Don't use long paragraphs



#### On aesthetics

* Don't use gigantic headers

* Make line-spacing 75-100% of the font size.

* Don't use difficult
