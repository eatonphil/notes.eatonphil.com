# Writing to be read
## May 18, 2018

There is a daily fight in the writing and maintenance of
documentation, checklists, emails, guides, etc. Each provides immense
value; a document may be the key to an important process. The goal is
to remove barriers -- to encourage understanding and correct
application of what has been noted -- without requiring a change in
the character of the reader. Ignoring imperfections in the *ideas*
transcribed into writing, there are particular aesthetic approaches I
take to (hopefully) make my notes more effective.

These ideas have been influenced by readings on writing, pyschology,
and user experience. I'd immediately point to [On Writing
Well](https://amzn.to/2rT0dsE), [Thinking Fast and
Slow](https://amzn.to/2IttNAl), and [Nielsen
Norman](https://www.nngroup.com/) research.

### Language correctness

The low-hanging fruit is spelling and grammatical correctness. It is
not difficult to provide. However don't be a grammar stickler
unreasonably, language is flexible and always changing. Use full
sentences, capitalize appropriately, and use punctuation. Don't allow
anyone the opportunity to take your work less seriously by screwing up
the basics.

### Structuring sentences and paragraphs

Keep your sentences short. And avoid run-on sentences; they are always
difficult to parse. If you use more than two commas in a sentences
(aside from in lists), the sentence is terrible. Split it up. In some
cases your sentence may even be perfectly correct without certain
commas. If you ever have a list containing another list, separate the
outer list with semi-colons instead of commas to differentiate.

Keep your paragraphs short too. The longer sentences and paragraphs
go, the more intimidating they look and will discourage readers from
continuing.

#### Visually speaking

Make your line height
[120-145%](https://practicaltypography.com/line-spacing.html) the
height of the font. Increasing the spacing between lines will make the
paragraph look less dense.

Additionally, a number of studies suggest that limiting the width of
paragraphs of text increases readability. For best results, limit the
width such that [50-75
characters](https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability) appear
per line of text.

#### Don't put checklists in paragraphs

If a document describes concrete steps that should be followed and can
be reasonably summarized, don't mask them within paragraphs of
text. Instead use an ordered or unordered list to clearly enumerate
the expectations. You cannot expect a checklist to be followed when it
is hidden unclearly within the sentences of a paragraph.

### Structuring sections

Always provide headers (with an HTML `id` attribute) to give relief
and to allow a direct link to a particular section in a long page. If
the page has more than two sections or vertically flows beyond a
single screen, consider adding a table of contents at the top of the
page to allow the reader to find the exact section she needs.
