# Writing to be read
## May 18, 2018

There is a daily struggle in the writing and maintenance of
documentation, checklists, emails, guides, etc. Each provides immense
value; a document may be the key to an important process. The goal is
to remove barriers -- to encourage understanding and correct
application of what has been noted -- without requiring a change in
the character of the reader. That is, expect reading to be difficult
and people to be lazy. **Don't make things harder for your reader than
need be.**

Ignoring imperfections in the *ideas* transcribed into writing, there
are particular aesthetic approaches I take to (hopefully) make my
notes more effective.  These ideas have been influenced by readings on
writing, psychology, and user experience. I recommend

### Language correctness

The low hanging fruit is spelling and grammatical correctness. It is
not difficult to achieve. Use full sentences, capitalize
appropriately, and use punctuation. But don't be a grammar stickler
unreasonably; language is flexible and always changing. Don't allow
anyone the opportunity to take your work less seriously by screwing up
the basics.

### Structuring sentences and paragraphs

Keep your sentences short. And avoid run on sentences; they are always
difficult to parse. If you use more than two commas in a sentences
(aside from in lists), the sentence is terrible. Split it up. Commas
are often used superfluously. Don't do that.

Remember that if a comma separates two sentences, they could probably
actually be two sentences -- or separated by a semi colon instead. If
you ever have a list containing another list, separate the outer list
with semi colons instead of commas to provide better differentiation.

Keep your paragraphs short too. In primary school you may have learned
to use 5-8 sentences per paragraph. Don't do so needlessly. 3-5
sentences can be perfectly appropriate. As both sentences and
paragraphs get longer, they appear more intimidating and can
discourage readers from continuing.

<div class="note">
  <header class="note-header">Visually speaking</header>
  <p>
    Make your line height
    <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/line-spacing.html">120-145%</a>
    the height of the font. Increase the spacing between lines in a
    paragraph to make the paragraph less dense and more friendly.

    Additionally, a number of studies suggest that limiting the width
    of text increases readability. For best results, limit the width
    such
    that <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability">50-75
    characters</a> appear per line of text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep contrast high. Don't put very gray (or colored) text on a
    white background.
  </p>
</div>

#### Don't put checklists in paragraphs

If a document describes concrete steps that should be followed exactly
and can be reasonably summarized, don't hide the steps within
paragraphs of text. Instead use an ordered or unordered list to
clearly enumerate the expectations. **You can't expect a checklist to
be followed when it is hidden within the sentences of a paragraph.**

### Structuring sections

Always provide headers (with an HTML `id` attribute) to give relief
and to allow a direct link to a particular section in a long page. If
the page has more than two sections or vertically flows beyond a
single screen, consider adding a table of contents at the top of the
page to allow the reader to find the exact section she needs.

<div class="note">
  <header class="note-header">Visually speaking</header>
  <p>
    Don't put large headers immediately next to each other. It is
    disruptive to have multiple lines of large text.
  </p>
</div>
