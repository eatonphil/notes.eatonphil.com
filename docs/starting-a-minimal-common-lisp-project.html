        <p>If you've only vaguely heard of Lisp before or studied Scheme in
school, Common Lisp is nothing like what you'd expect. While
functional programming is all the rage in Scheme, Common Lisp was
"expressly designed to be a real-world engineering language rather
than a theoretically 'pure' language" (<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html">Practical Common
Lisp</a>).
Furthermore, <a href="http://sbcl.org/">SBCL</a> -- a popular implementation --
is a highly optimized compiler that is competitive with
<a href="https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/lisp.html">Java</a>.</p>
<h3 id="building-blocks">Building blocks</h3><p>Common Lisp symbols, imagine "first-class" variables/labels, are
encapsulated in namespaces called packages. However packages don't
account for organization across directories, among other things. So
while packages are a part of the core Common Lisp language, the
"cross-directory" organizational structure is managed by the
(all-but-standard) <a href="https://github.com/fare/asdf">ASDF</a> "systems". You
can think of packages as roughly similar to modules in Python whereas
systems in ASDF are more like packages in Python.</p>
<p>ASDF does not manage non-local dependencies. For that we use
<a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, the defacto package
manager. ASDF should come bundled with your Common Lisp installation,
which I'll assume is SBCL (not that it matters). Quicklisp does not
come bundled.</p>
<h3 id="getting-quicklisp">Getting Quicklisp</h3><p>You can follow the notes on the Quicklisp
<a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">site</a> for installation, but the
basic gist is:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs shell">$ curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
$ sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp
...
* (quicklisp-quickstart:install)
...
* ^D
$ sbcl --load &quot;~/quicklisp/setup.lisp&quot;
...
* (ql:add-to-init-file)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="a-minimal-package">A minimal package</h3><p>Now we're ready to get started. Create a directory using the name of
the library you'd like to package. For instance, I'll create a
"cl-docker" directory for my Docker wrapper library. Then create a
file using the same name in the directory with the ".asd" suffix:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs shell">$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir cl-docker
$ touch cl-docker/cl-docker.asd
</code></pre>
<p>It is important for the ".asd" file to share the same name as the
directory because ASDF will look for it in that location (by default).</p>
<p>Before we get too far into packaging, let's write a function we'd like
to export from this library. Edit "cl-docker/docker.lisp" (this name does
not matter) and add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lisp">(defun ps ()
  (let ((output (uiop:run-program &#39;(&quot;docker&quot; &quot;ps&quot;) :output :string)))
    (loop for line in (rest (cl-ppcre:split &quot;(\\n+)&quot; output))
      collect (cl-ppcre:split &quot;(\\s\\s+)&quot; line))))
</code></pre>
<p>This uses a portable library, "uiop", that ASDF exposes by default (we
won't need to explicitly import this anywhere because the package is
managed by ASDF). It will run the command "docker ps" in a subprocess
and return the output as a string. Then we use the regex split
function from the "cl-ppcre" library to split the output first into
lines, take all but the first line, and split the lines up based one
two or more whitespace characters.</p>
<p>Next let's define the package (think module in Python) by editing
"cl-docker/package.lisp" (this name also does not matter):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lisp">(defpackage cl-docker
  (:use cl)
  (:import-from :cl-ppcre :split)
  (:export :ps))
</code></pre>
<p>Here we state the package's name, say that we want to import all
Common Lisp base symbols into the package, say we want to import the
"split" symbol from the "cl-ppcre" package, and say we only want to
export our "ps" function.</p>
<p>At this point we must also declare within the "cl-docker/docker.lisp"
file that it is a part of this package:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lisp">(in-package :cl-docker)

(defun ps ()
  (let ((output (uiop:run-program &#39;(&quot;docker&quot; &quot;ps&quot;) :output :string)))
    (loop for line in (rest (cl-ppcre:split &quot;(\\n+)&quot; output))
      collect (cl-ppcre:split &quot;(\\s\\s+)&quot; line))))
</code></pre>
<p>Next let's define the system (ASDF-level, similar to a package in Python)
in "cl-docker/cl-docker.asd":</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lisp">(defsystem :cl-docker
    :depends-on (:cl-ppcre)
    :serial t
    :components ((:file &quot;package&quot;)
                 (:file &quot;docker&quot;)))
</code></pre>
<p>This defines all the pieces of the system for ASDF: the system name,
the package definition and the component of the package
("cl-docker/docker.lisp"), and tells ASDF to make the "cl-ppcre"
system on disk available to us. We also tell ASDF to process the
components in the order we specified (otherwise it will pick an order
that may not be what we want).</p>
<p>In preparation for times when we don't have the "cl-ppcre" system (or
any other dependencies) on disk, we always load the system indirectly
through Quicklisp (rather than directly via ASDF) so Quicklisp can
fetch any missing dependencies from its repository of systems.</p>
<p>But before then -- unless you put this directory in "~/common-lisp" --
you'll need to register the directory containing the directory of your
system definitions so ASDF (and Quicklisp) know where to look if you
ask to load this system.</p>
<p>To do this, add a ".conf" file to
"~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/" and add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lisp">(:tree &quot;~/path/to/dir/containing/system/dir&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>So if you had a repo called "cl-docker" in your "~/projects" directory
that contained the "cl-docker" directory we previously created (that,
in turn, contains the "cl-docker.asd", "package.lisp", and
"docker.lisp" files) then you might create
"~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/1-cl-docker.conf" and
add:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lisp">(:tree &quot;~/projects/cl-docker&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="using-the-system">Using the system</h4><p>Now you can use the library from anywhere on your computer. Enter a
Common Lisp REPL and tell Quicklisp to load the system (and download
any non-local dependencies):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs shell">$ sbcl
...
* (ql:quickload &quot;cl-docker&quot;)
To load &quot;cl-docker&quot;:
  Load 1 ASDF system:
    cl-docker
; Loading &quot;cl-docker&quot;
..................................................
[package cl-docker]
(&quot;cl-docker&quot;)
* (cl-docker:ps)
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>

<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3><p>Common Lisp is easy to work with, the packages are many and mature.
Configuring an ASDF package is even simpler than configuring a Python
"setup.py". I didn't demonstrate pinning versions of dependencies in
ASDF, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21663603/1507139">of course</a>
you can do that too. If any of this -- as simple as it is -- seems
tedious, you can also use Zach Beane's (creator of Quicklisp)
<a href="http://xach.livejournal.com/278047.html">quickproject</a> tool to build
out the structure for you.</p>
<h3 id="resources-for-common-lisp">Resources for Common Lisp</h3><p>You must read <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common
Lisp</a>. It is freely available
online. It is one of the best resources I keep referring to in
dealing with simple issues (as a new Lisper, I stumble on a lot of
simple issues).</p>
<p>Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> is also
a must-read when you want to get a better understanding of macros in
Lisp. It will help you out with macros in Scheme too. This book is
freely available online, but out of print physically. I sent
<a href="https://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a> the PDF and I received my physical copy
for under $20 (including shipping).</p>
<p>I'm currently making my way through <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">Common Lisp the Language, 2nd
Edition</a> which I
believe is also freely available online. However I don't really
recommend this unless you are interested in implementing Common Lisp
or are dying to learn the standard library (not a bad idea).</p>
<p>Finally, Peter Norvig's <a href="https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp">Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence
Programming</a> just recently became
freely available online. I haven't yet read it but I'm queuing it
up. Don't let the title scare you, apparantly it is primarily
considered a practical guide to Common Lisp around
old-school/classical AI that isn't supposed to encumber.</p>
<p class="note">
  It
  was <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/971419419862847494">pointed
  out</a> on Twitter that Paul
  Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html">ANSI Common
  Lisp</a> and the
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw70/CLHS/Front/Contents.htm">CLHS</a>
  are probably better resources for the Common Lisp that exists today
  than Common Lisp the Language 2. CLtL2 is pre-standard.
</p><p>Additionally, the <a href="http://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/">Common Lisp
Cookbook</a> is a great
resource for Common Lisp recipes. It's been around since 2004 (on
Sourceforge) but has been pretty active recently and has been revived
on Github pages.</p>
<h3 id="on-scheme">On Scheme</h3><p>I've done one or two unremarkable web prototypes in <a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken
Scheme</a>, an R5RS/R7RS Scheme implementation.
I don't think Chicken Scheme is the best bet for the web (I'm mostly
biased to this topic) because it has no native-thread support and
there are lighter interpreters out there that are easier to embed
(e.g. in nginx). Chicken Scheme's "niche" is being a generally
high-quality implementation with a great <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/chicken-projects/egg-index-4.html">collection of 3rd-party
libraries</a>,
but it is also not the
<a href="https://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/">fastest</a> Scheme you could
choose.</p>
<p>I've worked on a larger web prototype -- a Github issue reporting app
-- in <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, a derivative of Scheme
R6RS. And I've blogged
<a href="http://notes.eatonphil.com/walking-through-a-basic-racket-web-service.html">favorably</a>
about Racket. It is a
<a href="https://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/">high-performance</a>
interpreter with a JIT compiler, has thread support, and is also well
known for its collection of <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/">3rd-party
libaries</a>. However the Racket ecosystem
<a href="https://fare.livejournal.com/188429.html">suffers</a> from the same
issues Haskell's does: libraries and bindings are primarily
proof-of-concept only; missing documentation, tests and use. Trying to
render "templatized" HTML (like Jinja allows for in Flask) without
using S-exp-based syntax was a nightmare.  (Read: there's space for
someone to write a good string templating library.)</p>
<h4 id="sorry,-racket">Sorry, Racket</h4><p>Last point on Racket (because it really is worth looking into),
debugging in that Github issue project was not fun. The backtraces
were mostly useless. Naively I assume this may have to do with the way
Racket optimizes and rewrites functions. I was often left with zero
context to find and correct my errors. But it could very well be I
was making poor use of Racket.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-other-hand">On the other hand</h4><p>Common Lisp (its implementations and ecosystem) seems more robust and
developed. SBCL, with it's great performance and native-thread
support, is a promising candidate for backend web development.</p>
