<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/235560.The_Two_Koreas">The Two Koreas by Don Oberdorfer</a><ul>

</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2360599.Making_Common_Sense_of_Japan">Making Common Sense of Japan by Steven R. Reed</a><ul>
<li>It can be difficult to find English translations of Korean, Japanese history by Korean and Japanese authors; this is a good one by an American professor</li>
