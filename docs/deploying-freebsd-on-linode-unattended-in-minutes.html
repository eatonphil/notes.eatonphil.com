        <p>I became a FreeBSD user over 2 years ago when I wanted to see what all
the fuss was about. I swapped my y410p dual-booting Windows / Ubuntu
with FreeBSD running Gnome 3. I learned a lot during the transition
and came to appreciate FreeBSD as a user. I soon began running FreeBSD
as my OS of choice on cloud servers I managed. So naturally, when I
started working at Linode a year ago I wanted to run FreeBSD servers
on Linode too.</p>
<p>Linode is a great platform for running random unofficial images
because you have much control over the configuration. I followed
<a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/custom-kernels-distros/install-freebsd-on-linode/">existing</a> <a href="https://forum.linode.com/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=12080">guides</a> closely and was soon able to get a number of
operating systems running on Linodes by installing them manually:
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Minix3, and SmartOS to date.</p>
<p>Unofficial images come at a cost though. In particular, I became
frustrated having to reinstall using the installer every time I
managed to trash the disk. So over the past year, I spent time trying
to understand the automated installation processes across different
operating systems and Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Unattended installations are tough. The methods for doing them differ
wildly. On RedHat, Fedora, and CentOS there is <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/installation_guide/ch-kickstart2">Kickstart</a>. On
Debian and Ubuntu there is <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed">preseeding</a>. Gentoo, Arch, and FreeBSD
don't particularly have a framework for unattended installs, but the
entire installation process is well-documented and inherently
scriptable (if you put in the effort). OpenBSD has
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.0/man8/autoinstall.8">autoinstall</a>. Trying to understand each and every one of these
potential installation methods was pretty defeating for getting
started on a side-project.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I finally had the silly revelation that I didn't need
to script the installation process -- at least initially. I only had
to have working images available somewhere that could be copied to new
Linodes. Some OSs / distributions may provide these images, but there
is no guarantee that they exist or work. If I tested and hosted them
for Linodes, anyone could easily run their own copy.</p>
<p>I began by running the installation process as normal for
FreeBSD. After the disk had FreeBSD installed on it, I rebooted into
<a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/troubleshooting/rescue-and-rebuild/">Finnix</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/disk_cloning#Create_disk_image">made a compressed disk image</a>, and transferred it to
an "image host" (another Linode in Fremont running an FTP
server). Then I tested the reversal process manually to make sure a
new Linode could grab the image, dd it to a disk, reboot and have a
working filesystem and networking. (This transfer occurs over private
networking to reduce bandwidth costs and thus limits Linode creation
to the datacenter of the image host, Fremont.)</p>
<p>Then it was time to script the process. I looked into the existing
Linode API client wrappers and noticed none of them were
documented. So I took a day to write and document a good part of a
<a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/python3-linode_api3">new Linode Python client</a>.</p>
<p>I got to work and out came the <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/linode_deploy_experimental">linode-deploy-experimental</a>
script. To run this script, you'll need an <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/api/api-key/">API token</a>. This
script will allow you to deploy from the hosted images (which now
include FreeBSD 11.0 and OpenBSD 6.0). Follow the example line in the
git repo and you'll have a Linode running OpenBSD or FreeBSD in
minutes.</p>
<p>Clearly there's a lot of work to do on both this script and on the
images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fremont datacenter has the only image host.</li>
<li>The script does not change the default password: "password123".
You'll want to change this immediately.</li>
<li>The script does not automatically grow the file system after
install.</li>
<li>The TTY config for these images currently requires you to use
Glish instead of Weblish.</li>
<li>And <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/linode_deploy_experimental/issues">more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if many of these issues do get sorted out (I assume they will),
keep in mind that these are unofficial, unsupported images. Some
things will probably never work: backups, password reset, etc. If you
need help, you are probably limited to community support. You can also
find me with any questions (peaton on OFTC). But for me this is at
least a slight improvement on having to run through the install
process every time I need a new FreeBSD Linode.</p>
