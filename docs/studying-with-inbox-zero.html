        <p>The only time I've been able to seriously, rapidly improve my ability
to speak a foreign language was through intensive language courses in
college. I was forced to actively speak, read, and write Chinese for
6-8 hours a week (1-2 hours every day). Then study another 5-10 hours
a week in preparation for the active sessions. I went three semesters
like this before I left school.</p>
<p>I've been trying to recreate that intensity since and mostly
failed. After marrying a Korean, I've redirected the little effort I
can muster to learning Korean. Aside from stints over the years
(mostly for a month or two before or after a trip to Korea), I haven't
been able to keep up any practice.</p>
<p>One thing I've tried over the years to commit myself to learning a
number of different topics is to set up recurring calendar invites:
"Study Linux", "Study TCP/IP", "Study Korean", etc.</p>
<p>This has mostly failed too. However, I do always <em>look</em> at the
invites as I get notified.</p>
<p>I keep inbox zero and I check my email many times a day, marking each
email read dilligently when I no longer need to think about it.</p>
<p>Tools like Quizlet, Anki, or even Duolingo let you self-learn
vocabulary <em>when you feel like it</em>. But basically no service
will try to keep giving you exposure to some set of topics whether you
spend time on it or not.</p>
<p>The most important thing I can think of is forced exposure to
vocabulary. So I've been planning for some time to hook up a list of
the one thousand most common Korean words to scheduled emails.</p>
<p>This weekend I finally got around to scripting the Google Calendar API
against the words list. I have an event for each word for the next
1000 days. Each day I receive a summary email including all events of
the day and the new word is part of it.</p>
<p>This is a pretty indirect approach but it's pretty simple to set
up. It's not very easy to reconfigure.</p>
<p>The code for doing this is <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/learnit">available on
Github</a> if you're
interested. And if you know a service that can build and manage
scheduled notifications against a spreadsheet or database I'd rather
be looking at that.</p>
<p>We'll see how this works out.</p>
