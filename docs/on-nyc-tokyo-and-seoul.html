        <p>I’ve lived in NYC for the past year — moved here after years in Philly
and after growing up in a rural community a few hours west of
there. My wife is South Korean and last week concluded my second trip
to the suburbs of Seoul to visit her family. We finished up that trip
with a week in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Long a mecha and Godzilla fan, I was struck by a city not
significantly more modern, or significantly more “Eastern”, than
NYC. In contrast, the lesser known Seoul is more modern than both
cities and shares as much “Eastern” vibe as Tokyo.</p>
<p>I’d go so far as to say that Seoul is the most livable of the three
for anyone of a similar background. There are a few concrete areas
that led me to this including transportation, apartments, WiFi/cafes,
food, and language.</p>
<p>I'll conclude with a few tourist recommendations and a list of books
to read on South Korea and Japan if you share my enthusiasm for
comparing life in different cities.</p>
<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3><p>NYC is one of the few cities in the world with a subway that runs
24/7. Tokyo and Seoul do not share this trait despite being many
decades newer. (Tokyo and Seoul were heavily damaged during World War
II and the Korean War, respectively.) And despite being built later,
Tokyo subway cars are even less wide than NYC subway cars (~8.2ft
vs. ~8.5ft).</p>
<p>In contrast, Seoul subway cars are ~10.2ft wide. The difference may
seem slight but it is noticeable during rush hour when in Seoul there
is space for four people to stand in the aisle versus room for perhaps
two in a Tokyo or NYC subway car.</p>
<p><img src="https://photos.travelblog.org/Photos/10223/428861/f/4174039-Seoul-subway-car-0.jpg" alt="Seoul subway car" />

<p>The Seoul subway system is also the most advanced in terms of
safety. All stations have a floor-to-ceiling barrier with doors that
only open when a train arrives. Most stations in Tokyo have a ~3ft
tall barrier that does the same, though some stations have no
barrier. In NYC there are no barriers anywhere.</p>
<p>Concerning innovation, Seoul and Tokyo both have multiple driverless
subway lines whereas NYC has none. But in terms of complexity the NYC
subway is the simplest because you pay only once. Seoul and Tokyo
subways are slightly more complex in that you swipe your card when you
enter and exit (or transfer).</p>
<h4 id="taxis">Taxis</h4><p>It was jarring to be greeted by the very 90s, vaguely British Toyota
Crown taxi cabs that dominate the streets of Tokyo.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WuIHqxY_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium" alt="Toyota Crown cab" />
<small>Source: Phil Eaton</small></p>
<p>These cabs have no integrated navigation unit but a modern unit was
typically mechanically attached. We saw a few of the recently approved
Toyota JPN Taxi, but they only account for around <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/05/23/business/taxi-tokyo-prepares-olympic-tourism-boom-accessible-cabs-international-drivers/">10
percent</a>
of cabs. (The integrated navigation is massive, perhaps 10-inch
screens.) In contrast, Seoul has a
<a href="http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/life/seoul-taxi-guide-783378/">variety</a>
of modern cabs all with integrated navigation — the most common of
which is the Hyundai Sonata.</p>

<p>Although Japanese car companies
<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/12q2-1993-eunos-mazda-cosmo-drive/">pioneered</a>
integrated navigation in the 90s, it appears to have been the standard
for South Korean car companies for the past 10-20 years.</p>
<p>And then there’s NYC with its primary mix of Crown Victorias and
Priuses with multiple 4-inch smartphones mechanically attached for
navigation.</p>

<h3 id="living">Living</h3><p>South Korea has no concept of the suburb oriented around single-family
houses. Drive an hour or two out from Seoul or Busan and see the same
massive, modern apartment complexes that are found in the city
center. After that it's the stark farms of Kansas. Japan appears more
like the US in that the city graduates steadily to suburb and farm.</p>

<p>In general, buildings in South Korea are fairly homogeneous. Even the
downtown areas of Seoul have little architectural creativity. Tokyo
and NYC are both diverse in building styles and sizes. However, NYC
takes the cake for ubiquity of massive towers. In fact, the first time
my South Korean father-in-law visited Manhattan he was blown away by
this mass.</p>

<small>New York City, source: Wikipedia</small></p>
<p>The most popular neighborhoods in Tokyo seem more developed than their
Seoul counterparts, the mass of stores and crowds extends further. And
while the average age of buildings in Tokyo seems younger than the
average age of buildings throughout Seoul (including less desirable
areas), the developed areas (including buildings and streets) of Seoul
are significantly cleaner and more modern. In contrast, and on average,
Tokyo buildings seem as old as NYC buildings.</p>

<h4 id="air-quality">Air quality</h4><p>Air quality in <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/in/New-York">NYC</a> and
<a href="https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/in/Tokyo">Tokyo</a> is high, pollution
is low. But in <a href="https://www.upi.com/Fine-dust-levels-soar-in-South-Korea/5581523776231/">recent
times</a>,
air quality in Seoul has deteriorated with dangerous levels of fine
dust from factories in South Korea and China. It is not clear when or
how the South Korean government will address this.</p>
<h3 id="wifi/cafes">WiFi/Cafes</h3><p>My idea of a good cafe is a decent ratio of seats to traffic,
available electrical outlets, and decent WiFi. NYC and Tokyo have some
similarities: chain coffee shops are larger and non-chains are often
pretty small. Tokyo differs from NYC in that there are few electrical
outlets and in the existence of interior smoking sections. (Tokyo bans
smoking while walking but designates areas like parks or inner
rooms in restaurants or cafes.)</p>
<p>But the WiFi in Tokyo is abysmal. Many cafes do not have it (though
the trend is to provide) and even the chains that do provide it have
terrible speeds reaching peaks of 5Mbps down. In NYC WiFi is available
near ~20Mbps down at most chains and ~5Mpbs at smaller non-chains.</p>
<p>In contrast, South Korea is the jewel of cafe culture. Unlike how in
the US coffee shop size decreases as population increases, coffee shop
sizes in South Korea are oddly enormous everywhere. South Korea is
rich with local shops, domestic chains (including the exported Paris
Baguette and Tous Les Jours), and foreign chains (South Korea has the
highest number of Starbucks Reserve stores per capita of any country).</p>
<p><img src="https://file.mk.co.kr/meet/neds/2018/06/image_readtop_2018_402044_15299876083365412.jpg" alt="" />

<p>From Jeju Island to Seoul we never worried about a seat or an outlet
at a cafe. Furthermore, the WiFi in South Korea is incredible. My
tech-hopeless in-law’s basic internet plan got 80Mbps down and the
small cafes near their apartment got at least 40Mbps down.</p>
<p>NYC falls closer to Seoul in terms of ubiquity and speed of WiFi and
has the added benefit of fast city-provided, outdoor WiFi surprisingly
fast and available throughout the city. NYC is much worse in terms of
daylight. Most cafes close between 8-10pm whereas cafes in Seoul and
Tokyo easily stay open past 11pm.</p>
<h4 id="caveat">Caveat</h4><p>It’s not exactly fair to exclude internet cafes, prevalent in both
Seoul and Tokyo (oddly even NYC has a
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=nyc+internet+cafe&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE0-PxuZTeAhWTdXAKHYDFB1cQ_AUIDigB">few</a>). At
an internet cafe in Tokyo you can expect abundant outlets and
excellent WiFi (I saw peaks of 40Mbps down). I did not visit an
internet cafe in Seoul but I expect it to be similar. In both Seoul
and Tokyo you can easily find 24/7 service (with showers!?).</p>
<p>I did not include internet cafes above because I find them slightly
less convenient for tourists. Though credit is due: unlike American
Chinatown internet cafes, the ones we visited in Tokyo were very
clean, spacious and warm.</p>
<p><img src="http://rakutama.com/en/images/shop/koriyama.jpg" alt="Internet cafe in Shinjuku" />

<h3 id="food">Food</h3><p>Dining out in NYC is similar in cost to other major US cities. The
quality is usually pretty good. Tokyo was about as expensive as food
in NYC and generally as high quality. For instance, most dinners in
NYC and Tokyo cost about $40-60 for two people. In contrast, most
entrees in Seoul are sold for two and the dinner in total was often
about $20-40. Restaurants on average seemed to be lower quality in
Seoul compared to Tokyo and New York, but there are still more than
enough high quality options.</p>
<h3 id="language">Language</h3><p>I am biased having a better knowledge of Korean than Japanese and a
South Korean partner to fall back on. But I believe South Korea is the
more friendly place for an English speaker in that it is more
dedicated to providing English translations and that the written
language is simpler. In both cities the penetration of
English-speaking natives (and quality of speech and comprehension) is
indistinguishable and decent.</p>
<p>To the first point, even the oddest locations and obscure signage had
English translations in South Korea (not just Seoul) — not so even
within Tokyo.</p>
<p>To the second point, Japanese has three writing systems (kanji,
hiragana, and katakana). Kanji (characters originating from Chinese)
cannot be replaced in writing by phonetic counterparts in hiragana or
katakana. So you have little choice but to memorize all important
characters, disregarding the fact that many characters can be broken
down. Then you must also memorize the alphabetic systems of hiragana
and katakana.</p>
<p>In contrast, Korean has two writing systems (hangul and hanja) where
hanja (characters originating from Chinese) is primarily used in
formal settings (government forms, academic books, etc.) and can be
replaced with the phonetic equivalent in hangul.</p>
<p>This makes it much simpler to memorize and read Korean compared to
Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="assorted-recommendations">Assorted recommendations</h3><p>For New Yorkers, don’t stay in the recommended areas of
Shinjuku/Shibuya/Roppongi unless you’re the type who’d enjoy staying
around Times Square. These three areas of Tokyo are just as obnoxious
albeit much safer. I also don’t recommend the Harajuku area; it is
extra. There’s no real equivalent level of crazy in Seoul although
Hongdae comes close.</p>
<p>In a future Tokyo trip I’d stick to the Meguro Station area including
Ebisu and Daikanyama. They are beautiful, quiet neighborhoods with
lots of restaurants and cafes beside the Meguro river. Areas along the
Sumida River are also beautiful and quiet. Ginza/Tokyo Station is
also a fun-but-not-obnoxious area to visit.</p>

<p>I cannot recommend the Edo-Tokyo Museum enough, it is the best city
museum I've visited. Tsukiji is also a must see, reminding me how much
I miss going to Reading Terminal Market each weekend in Philly.</p>
<p>In Seoul I’d recommend Yeonnam-Dong, Itaewon (which is much nicer than
it’s made out to be), and Gwanghwamun. Mapo-Gu in general is a great
region of Gangbuk as is the area below it (near Yeouido) in
Gangnam.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ttdg5Y7.jpg?maxwidth=640" alt="Yeonnam-dong" />

<p>I recommend visiting the National Museum of Korea in Seoul as well as
Hangang Park and Gyeongui Line Forest Park. The areas around the
Tancheon stream flowing South to Bundang are also beautiful.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I came to Tokyo with the expectation of a highly modern city fused
with Eastern culture. But it is difficult to see many ways it is ahead
of NYC technically and it is very similar to NYC culturally. In some
ways Tokyo even seems a little stuck in the past or just... off. Why
are all vending machines [e.g. for tickets, ordering food, etc.]
mechanical and not touch screens? The National Museum of Science is
awfully old and ugly, the National Diet Building the same.</p>
<p>So on the one hand I’d like to let the next person down lightly on the
excitement of Japan. It is a world-class city with great restaurants,
live music and refined culture but all-in-all very similar to NYC. On
the other hand I recommend Seoul for a cheaper, cleaner, more
English-speaker friendly, and genuinely novel city with splashes of
"Eastern" romantic elements like Tokyo.</p>

<h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2PNOsih">MITI and the Japanese Miracle: The Growth of Industrial Policy,
1925-1975</a> is an excellent, albeit somewhat
disputed introduction to the modern Japanese economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2EIw6hc">Asia’s Next Giant: South Korea and Late
Industrialization</a> is a similar high-quality
introduction to the South Korean economy.</p>
<p>If you’re only familiar with
US/Canadian companies or other “pure” market economies these two books
are a great read on different, challenging styles of government
policy, corporate structure, and life.</p>
<p class="note">
  P.s. I’m looking for book recommendations on the last 20 years of
  economic/political history in Japan and South Korean and on the last
  100 years of economic/political history in the US and NYC.
