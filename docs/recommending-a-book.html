        <p>Many "must-read" books are not well-written. I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50930981-phil-eaton">try to read a
lot</a>, but I
still have a low tolerance for bad writing and bad editing. I write
this post both to discourage thoughtless recommendations and to
encourage the receivers of bad recommendations.</p>
<p>For software developers, Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs is a prime example. Written for freshman at MIT, it is
ostensibly an entry-level text. But it requires such a level of
competence in math and physics, and the prose itself is so dense and
archaic, that I couldn't imagine suggesting it to anyone.</p>
<p>And yet it is one of the most recommended books for developers.</p>
<p>This is not to say that SICP is a bad book or that you should not read
it. I just don't think it should ever be suggested to anyone.</p>
<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3><p>The core goal of a book recommendation is for the reader to get
enjoyment or education from it. If you can't continue or finish a
book, you get nothing from it.</p>
<p>You, the recommender, diminish your impact if you can only recommend
books that people won't continue or finish.</p>
<h4 id="non-goal">Non-goal</h4><p>Some people have the capacity to read and love challenging books. If
that is you, you are not the audience of this post. I don't think
you'd disagree that most people are not like you.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why</h3><p>I have a few, not-mutually-exclusive guesses why "must-read" books are
often poorly written.</p>
<p>One guess is intelligence signalling. That it is human nature for a
person to suggest a book in an attempt make herself look smart rather
than to best assist the person asking for a suggestion.</p>
<p>Another guess is that most people don't read enough to have a good
feel for better or worse writing and editing.</p>
<p>And a final guess is that books that are worth reading might not
always be well-written. This is the most unfortunate guess of all. I
don't disagree that sometimes it is necessary to learn from
poorly-written books. But I begrudge this because of how much joy I
get from reading well-written books, fiction and non-fiction.</p>
<p>I have a feeling my guesses apply to recommendations in
general: music, art, film, musicals, restaurants, etc.</p>
<h3 id="instead">Instead</h3><p>My suggestion then to folks who are in the position of giving
recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you had a hard time reading a book or it took you too long to read it (yes, this threshold is different for everyone), don't recommend it</li>
<li>Don't be scared to recommend nothing, or to recommend against (rather than for) a certain book</li>
<li>Read more books</li>
</ol>
<p>And definitely don't recommend books you haven't read.</p>
<h3 id="mea-culpa">Mea culpa</h3><p>I've definitely done a bad job recommending books in the past,
including recommending books I haven't read. I'm trying to do better!</p>
