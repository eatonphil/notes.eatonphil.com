        <p>There is a common struggle in the writing and maintenance of
documentation, checklists, emails, guides, etc. Each provides immense
value; a document may be the key to an important process. The goal is
to remove barriers -- to encourage understanding and correct
application of what has been noted -- without requiring a change in
the character of the reader. That is, expect reading to be difficult
and people to be lazy. <strong>Don't make things harder for your reader than
need be.</strong></p>
<p>Ignoring imperfections in the <em>ideas</em> transcribed into writing, there
are a few particular aesthetic approaches I take to (hopefully) make
my notes more effective. These ideas have been influenced by readings
on writing, psychology, and user experience. In particular, I
recommend
<a href="https://amzn.to/2rT0dsE">On Writing Well</a>,
<a href="https://amzn.to/2IttNAl">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>,
and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman</a> research.</p>
<h3 id="language-correctness">Language correctness</h3><p>Spelling and grammatical correctness are low hanging fruit. They are
easy to achieve. Use full sentences, use punctuation, and capitalize
appropriately. But don't be a grammar stickler unreasonably; language
is flexible and always changing. Don't allow anyone the opportunity to
take your work less seriously by screwing up the basics.</p>
<h3 id="structuring-sentences-and-paragraphs">Structuring sentences and paragraphs</h3><p>Keep your sentences short. And avoid run on sentences; they are always
difficult to parse. If you use more than two commas in a sentences
(aside from in lists), the sentence is terrible. Split it up. Commas
are often used superfluously. Don't do that.</p>
<p>Remember that if a comma separates two sentences, you can separate
them into two sentences with a period instead. And if you ever have a
list containing another list, separate the outer list with semi colons
instead of commas to provide better differentiation.</p>
<p>Keep your paragraphs short too. In primary school you may have learned
to use 5-8 sentences per paragraph. Don't do so needlessly. 3-5
sentences can be perfectly appropriate. As both sentences and
paragraphs get longer, they appear more intimidating and can
discourage readers from continuing.</p>
<div class="note">
  <header class="note-header">Visually speaking</header>
  <p>
    Make your line height
    <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/line-spacing.html">120-145%</a>
    the height of the font. Increase the spacing between lines in a
    paragraph to make the paragraph less dense and more friendly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep contrast high. Don't put very gray (or colored) text on a
    white background.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, a number of studies suggest that limiting the width
    of text increases readability. For best results, limit the width
    such
    that <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability">50-75
    characters</a> appear per line of text.
  </p>
</div><h4 id="don't-put-checklists-in-paragraphs">Don't put checklists in paragraphs</h4><p>If a document describes concrete steps that should be followed exactly
and can be reasonably summarized, don't hide the steps within
paragraphs of text. Instead use an ordered or unordered list to
clearly enumerate the expectations. <strong>You can't expect a checklist to
be followed when it is hidden within the sentences of a paragraph.</strong></p>
<h3 id="structuring-sections">Structuring sections</h3><p>Any document (regardless the type) longer than 3-5 paragraphs should
be broken into sub-sections with summarizing headers to aid
scanning. Use the HTML <code>id</code> attribute to allow a direct link to a
particular section in a long page. If the page has more than two
sections or vertically flows beyond a single screen, consider adding a
table of contents at the top of the page to allow the reader to find
the exact section she needs.</p>
<div class="note">
  <header class="note-header">Visually speaking</header>
  <p>
    Don't put large headers immediately next to each other. It is
    disruptive to have multiple lines of large text.
  </p>
  <p>
    I almost completely avoid Github Markdown's h1/# tag because it is
    just too large and jarring relative to the rest of the text. It is
    often best for the flow of a Github Markdown document to stick to
    only h3-h4/###-#### tags for headers, using the h2/## tag for the
    document title.
  </p>
</div><h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3><p>The aesthetic flow of a document can help or hurt the experience of a
reader consuming it. Good aesthetic "sense" in this regard can be
boiled down to a few methods that primarily revolve around simplifying
structure and facilitating the rewarding feeling of progress as a
reader reads.</p>
<p>Writing is difficult and takes time to evolve helpfully. The dividends
are paid when process is better followed and questions are readily
clarified in writing without further human intervention. It is
incumbent on those writing and maintaining to organize effectively and
see confusion of the reader as fault of the document, not fault of the
reader. It is easier to change something yourself than to expect
others to change to accommodate you.</p>
