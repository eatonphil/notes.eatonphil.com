# How to get better at recursion

tldr; reimplement standard library functions in your favorite
language _without loops_.

### Background

For a few years after college I spent a lot of free time doing
projects in Standard ML and Scheme. As a result I got really
comfortable doing recursion. The two big reasons for this are 1)
neither Standard ML or Scheme have loops and 2) they both have very
small standard libraries. (Ok, they have loops. They're just so
limited as to be useless.)

I ended up building [a standard
library](https://github.com/eatonphil/ponyo) for Standard ML including
string functions (contains, indexOf, count, replace, etc.), an HTTP
server and client, a hash table, a binary search tree, parts of a
Standard ML parser, and [so on](https://ponyo.org/reference).

All of this without for loops.

### Strategy

The good news (if you don't want to learn a new language) is that you
don't have to take up Standard ML or Scheme to get better at
recursion. But you do need to dedicate some time to _practicing
recursion_ to get better at it.

My recommendation would be to pick 10-20 string or array functions out
of your favorite language's standard library and reimplement them
without for loops. (Obviously, start simple and just pick one. But
don't stop there.)

### Some examples

Here's an example reimplementation of <code>indexOf</code> in
JavaScript:

```javascript
function indexOf(input, toMatch) {
  function helper(index, offset, test) {
    if (index === input.length) {
      return -1;
    }

    if (toMatch === test) {
      return index;
    }

    if (input[index+offset] !== toMatch[offset] || test.length > toMatch.length) {
      return helper(index+1, 0, "");
    }

    return helper(index, offset+1, test+input[index+offset]);
  }

  return helper(0, 0, "");
}
```

Or here's an example immutable reimplementation of <code>insert</code>
in Python:

```python
def insert(arr, index, item):
  def helper(currentIndex, accum):
    if currentIndex == len(arr):
      return accum
    if currentIndex < index:
      return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [arr[currentIndex]])
    if currentIndex == index:
      return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [item, arr[currentIndex]])
    return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [arr[currentIndex]])
  return helper(0, [])
```

<p class="note">
  You're going to find an edge case and that's all right. The
  important part at the moment is practicing recursion.
</p>

For bonus points, avoid all mutation in your implementations and use
only tail recursion.

Happy recursion!
