# Enumerating and analyzing 40+ non-V8 JavaScript implementations
## September 21, 2021
###### javascript,nodejs,compiler,interpreter

V8 is, I'm sure, the most used implementation of JavaScript
today. Used in Chrome, (and by extension) Microsoft Edge, Node.js,
etc. Safari's JavaScriptCore and Firefox's SpiderMonkey are also
contenders for extremely mainstream implementations.

But what else is out there? What if I want to embed JavaScript in a C
program, or a Go program, or a Rust program, or a Java program(, and
so on)? Or what if I want to run JavaScript on a microcontroller? Or
use it as a base for language research? It turns out there are many
high-quality implementations out there.

This post describes a number of them and their implementation
choices. I'm not going to cover V8, JavaScriptCore, or SpiderMonkey
because they are massive and hide multiple various interpreters and
compilers inside. Plus, you already know about them.

<p class="note">
  I'm going to miss some implementations and get some details
  wrong. Please <a href="https://twitter.com/phil_eaton">Tweet</a> or
  <a href="mailto:phil@eatonphil.com">email</a> me with your corrections! I'd be
  particularly interested to hear about pure-research; and commercial,
  closed-source implementations of JavaScript.

own commercial, production applications.

I don't know whether to put Microsoft's ChakraCore into this list or
the next. So I'll put it here but note that as of this year 2021, they
are transitioning it to become a community-driven project.

### Mature, community-driven

Implementations toward the top are more reliable and
proven. Implementations toward the bottom less so.

If you are a looking to get involved in language development, the
implementation further down on the list can be a great place to start
since they typically need work in documentation, testing, and language
features.
