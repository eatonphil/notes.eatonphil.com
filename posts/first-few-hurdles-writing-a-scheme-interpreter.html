# First few hurdles writing a Scheme interpreter

I started working on [BSDScheme][0] last October, inspired to get back
into language implementation after my coworker built [bshift][1], a
compiler for a C-like language. BSDScheme is an interpreter for a
(currently small subset of) Scheme written in D. It implements a few
substantial primitive [functions][2] (in under 1000 LoC!). It uses the
same test framework bshift uses, [btest][12]. I'm going to expand here
on some notes I wrote in a [post][11] on Reddit on some issues I faced
during these first few months developing BSDSCheme.

Before I get too far, here is a simple exponent function running in
BSDScheme. It demonstates a few of the basic builtin primitives and
also integers being upgraded to D's [std.bigint][10] when an integer
operation produces an integer unable to fit in 64 bits. (See the
[times][14] and [plus][15] guards for details; see the [examples][13]
directory for other examples.)

```shell
$ cat examples/recursion.scm
(define (exp base pow)
  (if (= pow 0)
      1
      (* base (exp base (- pow 1)))))

(display (exp 2 64))
(newline)
$ ./bin/bsdscheme examples/exp.scm
18446744073709551616
```

The first big correction I made was to the way values are represented
in memory. I originally implemented BSDScheme's value representation
as a [struct][3] with a pointer to each possible value type. This
design was simple to begin with but space-inefficient. I modelled a
[redesign][6] after the [Chicken Scheme][4] data representation. It
uses a struct with [two fields][5], header and data. Both fields are
word-size integers (currently hard-coded as 64 bits). The header
stores type and length information and the data stores data.

In this representation, simple types (integers &lt; 2^63, booleans,
characters, etc.) take up only 128 bits. The integers, booleans, etc.
are placed directly into the 64 bit data field. Other types (larger
integers, strings, functions, etc) use the data field to store a
pointer to memory allocated in the heap. Getting the conversion of
these complex types right was the trickiest part of this data
representation effort... lots of void-pointer conversions.

The next big fix I made was to simplify the way generic functions
dealt with their arguments. Originally I passed each function its
arguments un-evaluated and left it up to each function to evaluate its
arguments before operating on them. While there was nothing
intrinsically wrong with this method, it was overly complicated and
bug-prone. I refactored the builtin functions into two groups:
[normal][2] functions and [special][7] functions. Normal function
arguments are [evaluated][8] before sending the arguments S-expression
to the function. Special functions receive the arguments S-expression
verbatim so they can decide what / when to evaluate.

The last issue I'll talk about in this post was dealing with the AST
representation. When I started out, the easiest way to get things
working was to have an AST representation completely separate from the
representation of BSDScheme values. This won't get you far in
Scheme. In order to (eventually) support macros (and in the meantime
support eval), the AST representation would have to make use of the
value representation. This was the most complicated and confusing
issue so far in BSDScheme. With the switch to recursive data
structures, it was hard to know if an error occurred because I parsed
incorrectly, or recursed over what I parsed incorrectly, or even if I
was printing out what I parsed incorrectly. After some embarrassing
pain, I got all the [pieces in place][9] after a month and it set me
up to easily support converting my original interpret function into a
generic eval function that I could expose to the language like any
other special function.

One frustrating side-effect of this AST conversion is that since the
parsing stage builds out trees using the internal value
representation, the parsing stage is tied to the interpreter. From
what I can tell, this basically means I have to revert back to some
intermediate AST representation or throw away the parser to support a
compiler backend.

Next steps in BSDScheme include converting all the examples into
tests, combining the needlessly split out lexing and parsing stage
into a single read function that can be exposed into the language,
fleshing out R7RS library support, and looking more into LLVM as a
backend.
