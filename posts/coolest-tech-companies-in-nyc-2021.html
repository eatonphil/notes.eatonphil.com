# Coolest hard-tech companies in NYC 2021
## June 4, 2021
###### startups,companies,nyc

For years I've kept a private list of really cool tech companies in
NYC. Now that I'm funemployed it's the perfect time to publish. This
list is influenced by 1) my perception of the difficulty of the
engineering behind the product and 2) the company's educational and
OSS presence.

With no further ado and in no particular order, here's my list!

### Backtrace

This company builds a product for debugging
mobile crashes. Your app produces a crash dump and their debugger will
help you figure out what went wrong. That's freaking awesome.

https://backtrace.io

### Equinix Metal (previously Packet)

This company provides an API around scheduling hardware servers in
their datacenters, not virtual machines. That's nuts.

https://packet.com

### Digital Ocean

Ok I used to work for Linode and am still a massive fan but I love all
the clouds and this post is about NYC not Philly. If you want to learn
how Linux works you have to work here.

https://www.digitalocean.com/

### NS1

This company does DNS. Seeing as [it was
DNS](https://www.cyberciti.biz/humour/a-haiku-about-dns/), if you want
to understand how the internet works go work for this group.

https://ns1.com/

### SquareSpace

The first program I made in 7th grade was a Java program that
generated HTML from terminal prompts in my first attempt at a
CMS. Stuff that builds stuff is amazing and SquareSpace is kinda OG.

They also just IPO-ed so the comp won't be imaginary!

Disclosure: my wife works here, but they've been on my list longer
than that.

### Grafana

Amazing platform. Everyone who can't afford Splunk or doesn't want to
buy competitor's products uses ElasticSearch and Grafana. I didn't
realize until double-checking my research that Grafana is even based
in NYC. Let's hope they're hiring developers here.

https://grafana.com/

### Frame.io

It's like Figma for video. Clearly the future.

https://www.frame.io/

### DataDog

DataDog feels like the only real competitor in the hosted server analytics.

Their stock has been doing surprisingly well, or maybe I'm just tired
from WeWork, Uber, et al.

### Chronosphere

I'm a sucker for startups doing hosted data and search because that's
really hard. Chronosphere does Uber-scale log storage/analysis.

https://chronosphere.io/

### Cockroach Labs

Worst company name but maybe one of the single coolest products in
NYC. They built a PostgreSQL compatible scalable platform in
Go. Everything about that is amazing.

They've also turned down my application like 5 times now though so
maybe they're very picky. :)

https://www.cockroachlabs.com/

### MongoDB

It's cloud scale! Need more be said.

https://www.mongodb.com/

### Trail of Bits

I don't actually understand what they do or if they have a product but
their [Github presence](https://github.com/trailofbits) is amazing and
they're dedicated to educating the community which is one of the most
important things I think a company can do.

https://www.trailofbits.com/

### Capsule8

I moved to NYC for this company because the founders and product are
insane. If you want to learn how compilers and Linux don't work,
you've got to come here.

Disclosure: I own stock.

https://capsule8.com/

### Two Sigma

Algorithmic trading? Maybe the smartest guys in NYC? They don't accept
candidates without bachelor's degrees or they just don't like me. ;)
They also host the only good tech meetups in NYC: Linux User Group and
Papers We Love.

https://www.twosigma.com/

### Jane Street

Another algorithmic trading company but this time with OCaml. They're
so crazy [you should see what the intern
built](https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2018/).

https://www.janestreet.com/

### Vimeo

Everybody loves an underdog story. And the [CEO seems really
cool](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/now-shes-ceo-vimeo-after-rejected-dozens-companies-mamta-shah-/).

https://vimeo.com/

### Etsy

Their blog posts and engineering organization philosophy are widely
regarded. And they've got a sweet headquarters in Brooklyn.

https://www.etsy.com/

### Sisense

If you're not using ElasticSearch and you're not using Splunk, you
might be using Sisense. Again, I'm a big sucker for data and analytics
platforms.

https://www.sisense.com/

### CodeAcademy

I am 100% on board with giving people opportunities in tech.

https://www.codecademy.com/

### Stack Overflow

They were just bought! But they still exist I suppose. If you love
.NET you've got to work here.

https://stackoverflow.com/

### That's it!

Tell me what you think and if I'm missing any hard-tech companies in
NYC. I'm sure I am.

As always, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:me@eatonphil.com) with
questions or ideas.
