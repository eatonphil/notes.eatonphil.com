In this post we'll extend the [ulisp
compiler](https://github.com/eatonphil/ulisp)'s LLVM backend to
support printing integers to stdout.

### Exit code limitations

Until now we've validated program state by setting the exit code to
the result of the program computation. But the exit code is an eight
bit integer. What if we want to validate a computation that produces
a result larger than 255?

To do this we need a way to print integers. This is challenging
because printing normally deals with byte arrays. libc's
<code>printf</code>, for example, takes a byte array as its first
argument.

The shortest path forward is to add support for system calls so we can
print one character at a time. Here's a version of a <code>print</code>
form that hacks around not having arrays to send each integer in a
number to stdout.

```lisp
(def print-char (c)
     ; First argument is stdout
     ; Second argument is a pointer to a char array (of length one)
     ; Third argument is the length of the char array
     (syscall/sys_write 1 &c 1))

(def print (n)
     (if (> n 9)
         (print (/ n 10)))

     ; 48 is the ASCII code for '0'
     (print-char (+ 48 (% n 10))))
```

In order to support this we need to add the
<code>syscall/sys_write</code>, <code>></code>, <code>%</code>,
and <code>/</code> builtin forms. We'll also need to add support for
taking the address of a variable.

All [code is available on Github](https://github.com/eatonphil/ulisp)
as is the [particular commit related to this
post](https://github.com/eatonphil/ulisp/commit/213b83b8e952c210ba408bf38e59ae677d19e643).

### References

The <code>sys_write</code> syscall requires us to pass the memory
address of the byte array to write. We don't support arrays, but we
can treat an individual variable as an array of length one by passing
the variable's address.

If we were compiling to C we could just pass the address of a local
variable. But LLVM doesn't allow us to take the address of variables
directly. We need to push the variable onto the LLVM stack to get an
address.

<p class="note">
  Under the hood LLVM will likely optimize this into a local variable
  reference instead of first pushing to the stack.
</p>

Since LLVM IR is typed, the value representing the address of a local
variable will be a pointer type. We'll need to refer to all uses of
this value as a pointer. So we'll need to modify ulisp to track local
types rather than hard-coding <code>i64</code> everywhere.

#### Scope

To begin we'll modify the <code>Scope</code> class to track types. We
only need to do this on registration. Afterward, we'll have to find
all uses of local variables to make sure they use the
local's <code>value</code> and <code>type</code> fields appropriately.

```javascript
class Scope {

  ...

  register(local) {
    let copy = local.replace('-', '_');
    let n = 1;
    while (this.locals[copy]) {
      copy = local + n++;
    }

    this.locals[local] = {
      value: copy,
      type: 'i64',
    };
    return this.locals[local];
  }

  ...

}
```

We won't go through every use of a <code>Scope</code> variable in this
post, but you can find it in the related [commit to
ulisp](https://github.com/eatonphil/ulisp/commit/213b83b8e952c210ba408bf38e59ae677d19e643).

#### Reference

The long-term approach for handling a reference syntactically is
probably to rewrite <code>&x</code> to <code>(& x)</code> in the
parser. The lazy approach we'll take for now is to handle a reference
as a special kind of identifier in <code>compileExpression</code>.

We'll use the LLVM <code>alloca</code> instruction to create space on
the stack. This will return a pointer and will turn the destination
variable into a pointer type. Then we'll use <code>store</code> to set
the value at the address to the current value of the variable being
referenced.

```javascript
class Compiler {

  ...

  compileExpression(exp, destination, context) {

    ...

    // Is a reference, push onto the stack and return its address
    if (exp.startsWith('&')) {
      const symbol = exp.substring(1);
      const tmp = context.scope.symbol();
      this.compileExpression(symbol, tmp, context);
      this.emit(1, `%${destination.value} = alloca ${tmp.type}, align 4`);
      destination.type = tmp.type + '*';
      this.emit(1, `store ${tmp.type} %${tmp.value}, ${destination.type} %${destination.value}, align 4`);
      return;
    }

    ...

  }

  ...
  
}
```

And now we're set to take the address of any code.

### System calls

LLVM IR provides no high-level means for making system calls. The
only way is to use inline assembly. This syntax is based on GCC inline
assembly and is confusing, with few explained examples, and unhelpful
error messages.

Thankfully the assembly code needed for a syscall is only one line,
one word: the <code>syscall</code> assembly instruction. We use inline
assembly variable-to-register mapping functionality to line up all the
parameters for the syscall. Here is an example:

```llvm
%result = call i64 asm sideeffect "syscall", "=r,{rax},{rdi},{rsi},{rdx}" (i64 %raxArg, i64 %rdiArg, i64 %rsiArg, i64 %rdxArg)
```

This says to execute the inline assembly string,
"syscall". The <code>sideeffect</code> flag means that this assembly
should always be run even if the result isn't used. <code>=r</code>
means the inline assembly returns a value, and the rest of the string
is the list of registers that arguments should be mapped to. Finally
we call the function with all the LLVM variables we want to be mapped.

<p class="note">
  Eventually we should also use the inline assembly syntax to list
  registers that are modified so that LLVM can know to save them
  before and after.
</p>

#### Code

We'll add a mapping for <code>syscall/sys_write</code> and a helper
function for generating syscall code using the example above as a
template. We'll suport 64-bit Darwin and Linux kernels.

```javascript
const SYSCALL_TABLE = {
  darwin: {
    sys_write: 0x2000004,
    sys_exit: 0x2000001,
  },
  linux: {
    sys_write: 1,
    sys_exit: 60,
  },
}[process.platform];

class Compiler {
  constructor() {
    this.outBuffer = [];
    this.primitiveFunctions = {
      def: this.compileDefine.bind(this),
      begin: this.compileBegin.bind(this),
      'if': this.compileIf.bind(this),
      '+': this.compileOp('add'),
      '-': this.compileOp('sub'),
      '*': this.compileOp('mul'),
      '%': this.compileOp('urem'),
      '<': this.compileOp('icmp slt'),
      '=': this.compileOp('icmp eq'),
      'syscall/sys_write': this.compileSyscall(SYSCALL_TABLE.sys_write),
    };
  }

  ...

  compileSyscall(id) {
    return (args, destination, context) => {
      const argTmps = args.map((arg) => {
	      const tmp = context.scope.symbol();
	      this.compileExpression(arg, tmp, context);
	      return tmp.type + ' %' + tmp.value;
      }).join(', ');
      const regs = ['rdi', 'rsi', 'rdx', 'r10', 'r8', 'r9'];
      const params = args.map((arg, i) => `{${regs[i]}}`).join(',');
      const idTmp = context.scope.symbol().value;
      this.emit(1, `%${idTmp} = add i64 ${id}, 0`)
      this.emit(1, `%${destination.value} = call ${destination.type} asm sideeffect "syscall", "=r,{rax},${params},~{dirflag},~{fpsr},~{flags}" (i64 %${idTmp}, ${argTmps})`);
    }
  }
}
```

### <code>></code>, <code>/</code>

Finally, we have a few new operations to add support for. But they'll
be pretty simple using the <code>compileOp</code> helper function.

```javascript
class Compiler {
  constructor() {
    this.outBuffer = [];
    this.primitiveFunctions = {
      def: this.compileDefine.bind(this),
      begin: this.compileBegin.bind(this),
      'if': this.compileIf.bind(this),
      '+': this.compileOp('add'),
      '-': this.compileOp('sub'),
      '*': this.compileOp('mul'),
      '/': this.compileOp('udiv'),
      '%': this.compileOp('urem'),
      '<': this.compileOp('icmp slt'),
      '>': this.compileOp('icmp sgt'),
      '=': this.compileOp('icmp eq'),
      'syscall/sys_write': this.compileSyscall(SYSCALL_TABLE.sys_write),
    };
  }

  ...
  
}
```

### print

We're ready to give our print function a shot.

```bash
$ cat test.lisp
(def print-char (c)
     ; First argument is stdout
     ; Second argument is a pointer to a char array (of length one)
     ; Third argument is the length of the char array
     (syscall/sys_write 1 &c 1))

(def print (n)
     (if (> n 9)
         (print (/ n 10)))

     ; 48 is the ASCII code for '0'
     (print-char (+ 48 (% n 10))))

(def main ()
     (print 1234)
     0)
$ node ulisp.js test.lisp
$ ./build/a.out
1234
```

Looks good! In the next post we'll talk about tail call elimination.
