# Porting a toy SQL database from Go to Zig

I learned a bit of Zig basics by implementing some programs for
[tinyprograms.org](tinyprograms.org). And to continue my understanding
of Zig I decided to try porting my [toy SQL database written in
Go](https://github.com/eatonphil/gosql).

Unlike some of my usual posts I'm not going to walk through the entire
codebase since it really is a direct port of the original code and I
feel like writing and reading that same post again would be boring.

So instead I'm going to [point you at the
codebase](https://github.com/eatonphil/zigrocks) and just talk a bit
about what I thought was interesting coming from Go, JavaScript,
Python, and (to a lesser degree) Rust.

### Memory management

First off, Zig doesn't come with a garbage collector. (However, while
researching for this post I notice that [Mitchell Hashimoto published
a Zig wrapper around Boehm
GC](https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-libgc).
