#### Score: 4.5 / 5

Paul Graham and his editor(s) are excellent. His prose is light and
easy to follow. The only awkward component of the book's organization
is that he tends to use a concept one section before explicitly
introducing and defining that concept. I'm not sure yet if this is a
good or bad thing.

### As a learning resource

Among books recommended to potential Lispers, *ANSI Common Lisp* is
typically written off. Graham's style of Lisp is called
"non-idiomatic". That's fair, both *ANSI Common Lisp* and *On Lisp*
feature aspects of Common Lisp that lend themselves to functional
programming. And as those of you who've read *Practical Common Lisp*
know, Common Lisp (unlike Scheme) was not designed to be a functional
programming language. Ultimately *ANSI Common Lisp* covers the same
topics *Practical Common Lisp* does, if not more. But *ANSI Common
Lisp* is better written, in less space, and with shorter examples.

I'm impressed at Graham's ability to summarize. There is a graphic
illustrating symbols as a structure composed of a name, a value, a
function, a package, and a property list. Although other resources
(books and otherwise) mention symbols as having one or more of these
components, his graphic was the first representation that clicked for
me. He also provides clarity about packages being namespaces for
*names* (symbols) not objects or functions.

And toward the end of the book, there is a discussion on the
"instance" abstraction (relative to the class definitions themselves)
being more powerful than plain "objects" that carry around methods
themselves. This has been the single most useful discussion on the
implementation of object-oriented constructs I've read yet.

### Digression on Practical Common Lisp

*Practical Common Lisp* is often called the best introduction to
Common Lisp. After reading both, I'd give *Practical Common Lisp*
second place or call it a tie. The issue with *Practical Common Lisp*
is that it takes too long to get anywhere and the practical chapters
themselves are just as much a slog. And for as big as it is,
*Practical Common Lisp* still doesn't include some major (potentially
confusing) aspects of "modern" Common Lisp like ASDF, Quicklisp,
production deployment strategies, etc.

Even after having read *Practical Common Lisp* I wasn't really clear
how to pull together all the libraries I needed to get anything real
done (e.g. scripting against an HTTP API or interacting with a SQL
database). This is not to say that *Practical Common Lisp* is a bad
book, it is a good book. But I definitely don't recommend reading it
without also reading *ANSI Common Lisp*. And regardless, there are
still a few of those modern concepts neither book covers.
