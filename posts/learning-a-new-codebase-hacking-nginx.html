# Learning a new codebase: hacking on nginx
## April 4, 2021
###### hacking,nginx,c

I have never contributed to nginx. My C skills are 1/10. But
downloading the source, hacking it up, compiling it, and running it
doesn't scare me. This post is to help you overcome your own fears
about doing so. Not necessarily because you should be running
out-of-tree diffs in production but because I see a lot of developers
never even consider looking at the source of a big tool or dependency
they use.

Most of all, studying mature software projects is one of the best ways
to grow as a programmer.

### Source and build

At a high-level, the steps for hacking on software projects are always
the same:

1. Find/download the source code
1. Install necessary dependency libraries/compilers
1. Start grepping around based on something you see in the output or capabilities you know exist
1. Make a change
1. Run some variation of <code>./configure && make</code> to build
1. Run the program
1. Go back to step 4 until you're happy

### nginx

Let's follow these steps for nginx. We google <code>nginx github</code>
to learn that there's a read-only copy of the source on
[Github](https://github.com/nginx/nginx).

```bash
$ mkdir ~/vendor
$ cd ~/vendor
$ git clone https://github.com/nginx/nginx
$ cd nginx
```

There's no readme, bummer. We google <code>nginx build from
source</code> and find
[this](http://nginx.org/en/docs/configure.html). We see it's a typical
C project that builds exactly as guessed: <code>./configure &&
make</code>. And it doesn't look like it has any third-party
dependencies besides my C compiler.

Install autoconf, gmake, and a C compiler. There's no `./configure`
file in this directory but notice there is a `configure` file in
`auto`. Trying `cd auto && ./configure` crashes so let's try
`./auto/configure`. That seems to do it except for the warning:

```bash
$ ./auto/configure
...
./auto/configure: error: the HTTP rewrite module requires the PCRE library.
You can either disable the module by using --without-http_rewrite_module
option, or install the PCRE library into the system, or build the PCRE library
statically from the source with nginx by using --with-pcre=<path> option.
```

Run `./auto/configure --without-http_rewrite_module`. And then again
when that fails but also omitting `http_gzip_module`.

Ok autoconfigure is done. Now we've got a Makefile. Run `make -j` to
compile using all cores.

Run `git status` to see where the binary was placed. Run `ls objs` and
there it is, great:

```bash
$ ls objs
autoconf.err  nginx    ngx_auto_config.h   ngx_modules.c  src
Makefile      nginx.8  ngx_auto_headers.h  ngx_modules.o
```

### The hack

We want a simple `dump` command that will return a literal string in a
`location` block. So something like this:

```diff
$ diff --git a/conf/nginx.conf b/conf/nginx.conf
index 29bc085f..e96e817f 100644
--- a/conf/nginx.conf
+++ b/conf/nginx.conf

@@ -41,8 +41,7 @@ http {
#access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

location / {
-            root   html;
-            index  index.html index.htm;
+            dump 'It was a good Thursday.';
         }

         #error_page  404              /404.html;
}
```

Now that we've built nginx we can use the `-t` flag to test the
validity of this config:

```bash
$ ./objs/nginx -t -c $(pwd)/conf/nginx.conf
nginx: [alert] could not open error log file: open() "/usr/local/nginx/logs/error.log" failed (2: No such file or directory)
2021/04/04 21:24:09 [emerg] 1030951#0: unknown directive "dump" in /home/phil/vendor/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:44
nginx: configuration file /home/phil/vendor/nginx/conf/nginx.conf test failed
```

And now we've got something to go on! Clearly we have to register this
directive and the log gives us enough info to start grepping:

```bash
$ git --no-pager grep 'unknown directive'
src/core/ngx_conf_file.c:                       "unknown directive \"%s\"", name->data);
```

The case that has this failing comes from line 463: `rv = cmd->set(cf, cmd, conf)`. So let's see what this `set` does. `git grep set` is useless. Let's try finding out what `cmd` is so we can locate the struct that has `set` on it. Ah it's an `ngx_command_t`. Since it doesn't have `struct` behind it it means it's typedef-ed and will likely have a `;` after it. So `git grep ngx_command_t\;` finds us:

```
$ git --no-pager grep ngx_command_t\;
src/core/ngx_core.h:typedef struct ngx_command_s         ngx_command_t;
```

Which means the implementation is hidden, so grep for ngx_command_s:

```bash
$ git --no-pager grep ngx_command_s
src/core/ngx_conf_file.h:struct ngx_command_s {
src/core/ngx_core.h:typedef struct ngx_command_s         ngx_command_t;
```

Ok this is going nowhere. Different approach. What command did we remove?

```bash
$ git --no-pager diff
diff --git a/conf/nginx.conf b/conf/nginx.conf
index 29bc085f..e96e817f 100644
--- a/conf/nginx.conf

         }

         #error_page  404              /404.html;
```

`root` is a command. Maybe we can copy that.

```bash
$ git --no-pager grep \"root\"

docs/xml/nginx/changes.xml:a request was handled incorrectly, if a "root" directive used variables;

```

That looks more promising. Let's copy that:

```bash

Ok so this is how a command is registered. It obviously won't build without `ngx_http_core_dump` so let's implement that by copying/renaming `ngx_http_core_root`:

```bash

The goal here is to just store the dump string on this conf
object. Then while serving the request we can check if this is set and
if so, respond to the request with this string.

This still clearly won't build because we didn't modify this conf
object. But let's run `make` anyway.

The dump handler is undeclared. While copying `ngx_http_core_root` earlier I saw that there was a forward declaration toward the top. Let's copy that as well and see if that fixes anything.

```bash
$ git --no-pager diff

Perfect. Now let's add `dump` as a member to this conf object.

```bash
$ git --no-pager grep ngx_http_core_loc_conf_t\;
src/http/ngx_http_core_module.h:typedef struct ngx_http_core_loc_conf_s  ngx_http_core_loc_conf_t;
```

Let's just clone the `root` member:

```bash

Run `make` and it succeeds!

Now we spend a few hours looking around for a good place to add a hook
during a request. Ultimately, `ngx_http_core_find_config_phase` seems
like a good place since only then will we be dealing with the struct
we added `dump` to.

Next step is figuring out how to send a response. Grepping for
`response` isn't super useful, neither is `write`. But `send` has some
pretty low-level but obvious behavior.

```bash
$ git --no-pager grep send\(
src/mail/ngx_mail.h:void ngx_mail_send(ngx_event_t *wev);
src/mail/ngx_mail_auth_http_module.c:    n = ngx_send(c, ctx->request->pos, size);)
...
```

That second result looks promising. Looking at that file it looks like
we need an object that has a `->data` member. In
`src/http/ngx_http_core_module.c` I noticed that the request object
has a member that looks interesting: `r->connection->write->data`. And
if we look up the signature we just need to also send `ngx_send` a
string and a length.

Thankfully we already have that from our `dump` member. So let's try something simple:

```bash
$ git --no-pager diff
diff --git a/src/http/ngx_http_core_module.c b/src/http/ngx_http_core_module.c

```

Run `make` and it's good!. Let's turn off the nginx daemon and worker processes so it's easier to quit as we're iterating.

$ git --no-pager diff conf/

Huh, that's unexpected. Let's try using telnet to get the whole raw

```

Oh man. That's super cool. Unfortunately it's also not valid HTTP. It
seems like if we're using `ngx_send` we'll have to set the HTTP
response headers manually.

If we're going to pass a literal string to `ngx_send` we'll have to
convert it to an `ngx_str_t`. Judging from `src/core/ngx_string.h` the
`ngx_string` macro should be able to do this.

Huh. It's no longer complaining about HTTP/0.9 but it's now
hanging. Let's try verbose curling.

Build, run, curl. Still hanging. Looking into the source code of
`ngx_http_finalize_request` it seems like there's a case where the
connection is completely closed if you pass in `NGX_HTTP_CLOSE`. Let's
try that.

```
$ curl localhost:2020

Well hot dog, it works.

### Reflection

Is this a good way to implement commands in nginx? No. While I knew a
bit about nginx modules as a user it's clear that as a developer this
command could have been implemented much more cleanly as a module too.

There also has to be higher-level tooling for returning constructing
responses rather than writing out headers manually.
