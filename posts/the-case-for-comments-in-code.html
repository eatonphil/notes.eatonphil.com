# The case for comments in code
## September 7, 2020

When I first started programming, especially when asked for code
samples, my comments lacked purpose and would often duplicate in
English what the code clearly indicated. I knew that "commenting is
good" but as a beginner I had no further insight.

Over time with the help of books like Clean Code, I grew disdainful of
comments. Good code should be self-documenting. Whenever I needed to
write a comment to explain something, I'd realize I could easily
rename some key variable or function. I grew more comfortable with
variables and functions with a few words in the title. Better to spend
time on good code structure and naming.

<p class="note">
  I have always left TODOs though, since TODOs can't so easily be
  expressed in variable names. But even these TODOs concerned me
  because they existed in my issue tracker, or maybe should have.

As I watched mature open source projects and mature engineers, I came
to value well-documented pull requests. Solid pull requests include or
link to all necessary background, opportunities failed or ignored, how
to use, links to external bugs requiring workarounds and the results
of performance evaluation.

Beyond pull request descriptions, when I really wanted to grease a
pull request I'd use the pull request UI to add comments calling
reviewer attention to key changes in lines of the diff.

Both kinds of guidance are a massive aid to reviewers, saving a lot of
time.

But when I'd find a bug in code -- and I knew there was good pull
request documentation, even for pull requests as recent as six months
ago -- I've been repeatedly failed by the pull request and _pull
request comment_ search exposed by Github and Gitlab.

I _knew_ there were links to documented oddities or bug reports in
pull request threads. But practically speaking, for historic pull
requests, pull request comments are useless.

This is the single biggest reason I've started to push for more
comments in code. More so than all other tools (issue tracker, code
management system, etc.) comments in code have the greatest chance of
still being around and _easily searchable_ if they haven't been
deleted.

<p class="note">
  Don't get me started on pull request documentation in an external
  medium like Slack. It's so rewarding to get or give instant feedback
  on changes on instant messengers, but good luck finding that
  discussion 3 months later.
</p>

Every time I have to call out a line of code in a pull request, that's
immediate cause for that code to be modified with comments.

Maybe I wouldn't do this if Github/Gitlab exposed a Google Docs-like
interface for browsing code line by line with links to all pull
request comment threads.
