# SMTP protocol basics from scratch in Go: receiving email from Gmail
## February 20, 2022
###### golang,smtp,networking

I've never run my own mail server before. Before today I had no clue
how email worked under the hood other than the very few times I've set
up mail clients.

I've heard no few times how hard it is to *send* mail from a
self-hosted server (because of spam filters). But how hard can it be
to hook up DNS to my personal server and receive email to my domain
sent from Gmail or another real-world client?

I knew it would be simpler to just send local mail to a local mail
server with a local mail client but that didn't seem as surely
real. But if I could send email from my Gmail account and receive it
in my server that would feel more rewarding.

I spent the afternoon digging into this. All code is [available on
Github](https://github.com/eatonphil/gomail). The "live stream" is in
the [Multiprocess Discord](https://discord.multiprocess.io)'s
&#35;hacking-networks channel.

### DNS

First I bought a domain. (I needed to be able to mess around with
records without blowing up anything important.)

I knew that MX records controlled where mail for a domain is sent. But
I had to [look up the
specifics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record). You need to
create an MX record that points to an A or AAAA record. So you need
both an MX record and an A or AAAA record.

![MX and A record settings](/dnsrecords.png)

Done.

### Firewall

The firewall on Fedora is aggressive. Gotta open up port 25.

```bash
$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=dmz --add-port=25/tcp --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=25/tcp --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

I don't understand what zones are here.

### What protocols?

I knew that you send email with SMTP and you read it with POP3 or
IMAP. But it hadn't clicked before that the mail server has to speak
SMTP and if you only ever read on the server (which is of course
impractical in the real world) you don't need POP3 or IMAP.

![SMTP vs POP3](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/smtp-protocol.png)

So to meaningfully receive email from Gmail all I needed to do was implement SMTP.

### SMTP

First I found the [RFC for
SMTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321) (or one of them
anyway) and [the wikipedia page for
it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol).

First off I'd need to run a TCP server on port 25.

```go
package main

import (
        "errors"
        "log"
        "net"
        "strconv"
        "strings"
)

func logError(err error) {
        log.Printf("[ERROR] %s\n", err)
}

func logInfo(msg string) {
        log.Printf("[INFO] %s\n", msg)
}

type message struct {
        clientDomain string
        smtpCommands  map[string]string
        atmHeaders   map[string]string
        body         string
        from         string
        date         string
        subject      string
        to           string
}

type connection struct {
        conn net.Conn
        id   int
        buf  []byte
}

// TODO

func (c *connection) handle() {
        // TODO
}

func main() {
        l, err := net.Listen("tcp", "0.0.0.0:25")
        if err != nil {
                panic(err)
        }
        defer l.Close()

        logInfo("Listening")

        id := 0
        for {
                conn, err := l.Accept()
                if err != nil {
                        logError(err)
                        continue
                }

                id += 1
                c := connection{conn, id, nil}
                go c.handle()
        }
}
```

Just a basic TCP server that passes off connections inside a
goroutine.

### Greeting

After starting a connection, the server must send a greeting. The
successful greeting response code is `220`. It can optionally be
followed by additional text. Like most commands in SMTP it must be
ended with CRLF (`\r\n`).

So we'll add a helper function for writing lines that end in CRLF:

```go
func (c *connection) writeLine(msg string) error {
        msg += "\r\n"
        for len(msg) > 0 {
                n, err := c.conn.Write([]byte(msg))
                if err != nil {
                        return err
                }

                msg = msg[n:]
        }

        return nil
}
```

And then we'll send that `220` in the `handle` function.

```go
func (c *connection) handle() {
        defer c.conn.Close()
        c.logInfo("Connection accepted")

        err := c.writeLine("220")
        if err != nil {
                c.logError(err)
                return
        }

        c.logInfo("Awaiting EHLO")

        // TODO
```

### EHLO

Next we need to be able to read requests from the client. We'll write
a helper that reads until the next CRLF. We'll keep a buffer of unread
bytes in case we accidentally get bytes past the next CRLF. We'll
store that buffer in the connection object.

```go
func (c *connection) readLine() (string, error) {
        for {
                b := make([]byte, 1024)
                n, err := c.conn.Read(b)
                if err != nil {
                        return "", err
                }

                c.buf = append(c.buf, b[:n]...)
                for i, b := range c.buf {
                        // If end of line
                        if b == '\n' && i > 0 && c.buf[i-1] == '\r' {
                                // i-1 because drop the CRLF, no one cares after this
                                line := string(c.buf[:i-1])
                                c.buf = c.buf[i+1:]
                                return line, nil
                        }
                }
        }
}
```

Now back in the `handle`-er we can read a line from the client. From
the RFC we can see it should be `HELO` or `EHLO`. Both sendmail locally
and Gmail only send `EHLO` though so we'll just check for that.

![EHLO response format](/ehloresponse.png)

So we'll validate the message sent is an `EHLO` and then we'll send
back a `250` with a space after it. We can ignore the rest of that
response grammar since we don't have additional keywords we want to
send to the client.

```
        ...

        c.logInfo("Awaiting EHLO")

	line, err := c.readLine()
	if err != nil {
		c.logError(err)
		return
	}

	if !strings.HasPrefix(line, "EHLO") {
		c.logError(errors.New("Expected EHLO got: " + line))
		return
	}

	msg := message{
		smtpCommands: map[string]string{},
		atmHeaders:  map[string]string{},
	}
	msg.clientDomain = line[len("EHLO "):]

        c.logInfo("Received EHLO")

        err = c.writeLine("250 ")
        if err != nil {
                c.logError(err)
                return
        }

        c.logInfo("Done EHLO")

        // TODO
```

### Additional commands

Next up there are a few commands we need to read before we get to the
message body. These include the recipient and the sender
address. These are formatted vaguely similar to HTTP headers. They
have a key on the left side of a colon and a value on the right. They
may have a required order too, I'm not sure.

In response to the commands we'll send a `250 OK`, although I'm not
sure where in the RFC that is suggested.

In our code we'll just keep looking for these commands until we find
the `DATA` command. This indicates the body is to follow. And to this
command we respond with a `354` instead of a `250 OK`.

![DATA response](/dataresponse.png)

In code:

```go
        ...

	c.logInfo("Done EHLO")

	for line != "" {
		line, err = c.readLine()
		if err != nil {
			c.logError(err)
			return
		}

		pieces := strings.SplitN(line, ":", 2)
		smtpCommand := strings.ToUpper(pieces[0])

		// Special command without a value
		if smtpCommand == "DATA" {
			err = c.writeLine("354")
			if err != nil {
				c.logError(err)
				return
			}

			break
		}

		smtpValue := pieces[1]
		msg.smtpCommands[smtpCommand] = smtpValue

		c.logInfo("Got command: " + line)

		err = c.writeLine("250 OK")
		if err != nil {
			c.logError(err)
			return
		}
	}

	c.logInfo("Done SMTP commands, reading ARPA text message headers")

        // TODO
```

### Message body, headers

Now that we've seen the `DATA` command we are within *a* message
body. Within this body we still have to read some additional headers.

Through trial-and-error I know to look for some headers like
`Subject`. By searching the RFC I noticed a reference to [RFC
822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822) where these headers
are defined.

![ARPA text message headers](/response.png)

These are ARPA internet text message headers apparantly. They also
look like HTTP headers but unlike HTTP headers they can span multiple
lines. This stumped me for a bit.

![Multi-line headers](/longheaders.png)

I decided to write a new `readLine` function that would specifically
look for these possibly multi-line headers where a CRLF followed by
whitespace isn't a line delimiter.

```go
func (c *connection) readMultiLine() (string, error) {
	for {
		noMoreReads := false
		for i, b := range c.buf {
			if i > 1 &&
				b != ' ' &&
				b != '\t' &&
				c.buf[i-2] == '\r' &&
				c.buf[i-1] == '\n' {
				// i-2 because drop the CRLF, no one cares after this
				line := string(c.buf[:i-2])
				c.buf = c.buf[i:]
				return line, nil
			}

			noMoreReads = c.isBodyClose(i)
		}

		if !noMoreReads {
			b := make([]byte, 1024)
			n, err := c.conn.Read(b)
			if err != nil {
				return "", err
			}

			c.buf = append(c.buf, b[:n]...)

			// If this gets here more than once it's going to be an infinite loop
		}
	}
}

func (c *connection) isBodyClose(i int) bool {
	return i > 4 &&
		c.buf[i-4] == '\r' &&
		c.buf[i-3] == '\n' &&
		c.buf[i-2] == '.' &&
		c.buf[i-1] == '\r' &&
		c.buf[i-0] == '\n'
}
```

Now back in the `handle` function we can read through all of these
headers. According to RFC 822, we're done when we see a double CRLF,
which in our code will show up as an empty line.

```go
        ...

	c.logInfo("Done SMTP headers, reading ARPA text message headers")

	for {
		line, err = c.readMultiLine()
		if err != nil {
			c.logError(err)
			return
		}

		if strings.TrimSpace(line) == "" {
			break
		}

		pieces := strings.SplitN(line, ": ", 2)
		atmHeader := strings.ToUpper(pieces[0])
		atmValue := pieces[1]
		msg.atmHeaders[atmHeader] = atmValue

		if atmHeader == "SUBJECT" {
			msg.subject = atmValue
		}
		if atmHeader == "TO" {
			msg.to = atmValue
		}
		if atmHeader == "FROM" {
			msg.from = atmValue
		}
		if atmHeader == "DATE" {
			msg.date = atmValue
		}
	}

	c.logInfo("Done ARPA text message headers, reading body")

        // TODO
```

### Body, for real

We're finally at the email body as the user typed it. According to the
SMTP RFC the body ends with a CRLF followed by a dot (period) followed
by a CRLF.

So we'll write another helper to read until this marker.

```go
func (c *connection) readToEndOfBody() (string, error) {
	for {
		for i := range c.buf {
			if c.isBodyClose(i) {
				return string(c.buf[:i-4]), nil
			}
		}

		b := make([]byte, 1024)
		n, err := c.conn.Read(b)
		if err != nil {
			return "", err
		}

		c.buf = append(c.buf, b[:n]...)
	}
}
```

And we can finish up the `handle` function.

```go
	c.logInfo("Done ARPA text message headers, reading body")

	msg.body, err = c.readToEndOfBody()
	if err != nil {
		c.logError(err)
		return
	}

	c.logInfo("Got body (%d bytes)", len(msg.body))

	err = c.writeLine("250 OK")
	if err != nil {
		c.logError(err)
		return
	}

	c.logInfo("Message:\n%s\n", msg.body)

	c.logInfo("Connection closed")
}
```

### Compile, setcap, run, and send

```bash
$ go build
$ sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./gomail
$ ./gomail
```

And send an email in Gmail! It can be to any user since we haven't
implemented anything regarding users. I'll send `What hath god
wrought` as the subject and message to `morse@binutils.org`.

And I see:

```bash

```

Which is pretty sweet!

### Multipart wut

Ok this body still clearly has some format. And if we dump the ARPA
text message headers we notice that Gmail 1) sets a Content-Type
header and 2) it's value is `multipart/alternative`. I don't know
where Content-Type as a valid header is defined because it's not in
RFC 822. Maybe it's some "new-fangled" adhoc standard or maybe it's
just an in extension RFC.

In any case this looks like multipart bodies in HTTP. I don't want to
deal with that so I'm just going to stop here.

But I *am* curious about text-only email systems. So I `sudo dnf
install php sendmail` and write a quick PHP script (thanks to @Josh on
Discord for the suggestion):

```php
<?php
  mail("morse@binutils.org", "What hath god wrought", "What hath god wrought", "");
?>
```

And run it:

```
$ php test.php
```

And in my `gomail` window I see:

```
2022/02/21 02:24:17 [INFO] Listening

And I'm happy to call it a night.
