  <p>
    Hey! I'm Phil. In the past 10 years I've been a
    developer or manager or founder; at startups like Capsule8,
    larger companies like Linode and Oracle, and my own Multiprocess
    Labs. I'm currently working on what's next. :)

I am a college dropout (not by choice; stay in school!) and for the
last 10 years I've chased my way down the software stack starting from
humble beginnings with the venerable jQuery and PHP.

This blog is mostly about about software internals; particularly
compilers, interpreters, programming languages, distributed systems,
databases, software emulation, networks, and so on.
