# About

  <p>
    Hey, hey, hey! I'm Phil. In the past 10 years I've been a
    developer or manager or founder; at startups like Capsule8,
    larger companies like Linode and Oracle, and my own Multiprocess
    Labs.
  </p>

Professionally I've done web development for (mostly) developer tools
companies. Frontend, backend, system administration, light UX
(i.e. wireframes), light product management (i.e. what the heck are we
building?), etc.

In my free time (and on this blog) I enjoy learning and writing about
software internals; particularly compilers, interpreters, programming
languages, distributed systems, databases, software emulation,
networks, and so on.

### Multiprocess Labs

I quit my job at Oracle in 2021 to
start <a href="https://multiprocess.io">Multiprocess Labs</a>
(just me) where I
built <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio">open-source
  data tools</a>
like <a href="https://datastation.multiprocess.io">DataStation
  (2.4k+ stars)</a>, an open-source data IDE for developers,
and <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq">dsq (2.6k+
  stars)</a>, a commandline tool for running SQL queries against
JSON, CSV, Parquet, Excel and more.

You can read about my experience doing this for a year
[here](https://datastation.multiprocess.io/blog/2022-06-11-year-in-review.html).

After an awesome year of this I'm now moving on (keeping everything
open-source and hacking on the side). And looking for what's next.

### Community

I host a [hacker Discord](https://discord.multiprocess.io) (1k+
members) designed to expose devs (and myself) to the internals of
databases, compilers, operating systems, browsers, emulators, etc. And
to provide a community around this kind of exploration.

More recently this has also expanded to include discussion around
experienced developers, engineering management, and
architecture/ops/production systems.
