  <p>
    Hey! I'm Phil. In the past 10 years I've been a developer or
    manager or founder or cofounder; at startups like Capsule8, larger
    companies like Linode and Oracle, and my own Multiprocess
    Labs.

  <p>
    Today I'm a cofounder
    at <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle">TigerBeetle</a>,
    an open-source database built from scratch for double-entry
    accounting.

I am a college dropout (not by choice; stay in school!) and for the
last 10 years I've chased my way down the software stack starting from
humble beginnings with the venerable jQuery and PHP.

This blog is mostly about software internals; particularly
compilers, interpreters, programming languages, distributed systems,
databases, software emulation, networks, and so on.
