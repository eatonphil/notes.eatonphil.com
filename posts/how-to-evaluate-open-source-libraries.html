# How to evaluate open source libraries
## December 22, 2021
###### open source

tldr:

* Consistent (but not necessarily frequent!) releases
* Automated testing
* Decent test coverage
* Automated builds of release artifact
* Not a lot of commented out code and tests
* Developer documentation
* Number of dependencies

As time goes on I only get pickier about the libraries I bring in or
if I bring in a library at all. When I'm looking at a library though I
look at the following categories. Sometimes you do need a library and
not all of these categories are well met. I don't think of these
categories as absolutes but about what makes me more or less
comfortable using a library.

And moreover none of these particularly cost actual money, even
automated testing. CI services have long offered completely free
compute for open source libraries.

This isn't a criticism of developers who have open source projects who
just haven't gotten to this level of maturity or aren't interested in
doing so. But there may be good reason to prefer some libraries.

Here are my categories in detail.

### Consistent releases

The most important thing to me is that the library has consistent
releases. This is not the same thing as having frequent
releases. Every library releases at a different pace. I'm completely
ok if the last release was a year or two ago if the library has had
consistent releases every year or two.

But if the releases are erratic and infrequent or just stopped
happening, I feel uncomfortable picking that library.

### Automated testing



For example, there's a database driver I'm using that doesn't have
automated testing in place. That makes me incredibly
uncomfortable. But it's the only good driver for that database for
that language so I'm stuck with it for the moment.

### Decent test coverage

Decent to me is at least 50% and ideally 70% line coverage. Anything
greater than that is impressive but 100% line coverage doesn't have a
great correlation to working software since you can mock out so much
to get to 100% test coverage that you aren't testing anything. So I'm
happy with 70% test coverage as a general indicator and I'd
also like to see integration or end-to-end tests.
