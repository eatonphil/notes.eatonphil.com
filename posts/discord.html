# Discord

I host a [hacker Discord](https://discord.multiprocess.io) (1k+
members) designed to expose devs (and myself) to the internals of
databases, compilers, operating systems, browsers, emulators, etc. And
to provide a community around this kind of exploration.

More recently this has also expanded to include discussion around
experienced developers, engineering management, and
architecture/ops/production systems.
