# Compilers aren't scary and they aren't low level

###### compilers

Ok some of them are scary and some of them are low level. But you can
write a C compiler [in
Python](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC) or
[JavaScript](https://github.com/Captainarash/CaptCC) or
[Ruby](https://github.com/south37/rucc).

You can write a compiler for any language in any language. In fact if
ease-of-programming is a priority, using a high-level language makes
writing a compiler easier, because coding in a high-level language is
easier. In contrast, the primary benefit you get from writing a
compiler in a low level language is that the compiler itself might
compile programs faster. But a compiler written in a low level
language can still generate programs that are incredibly slow.

And there is no reason programs _generated_ by a compiler written in a
high-level language will ever perform worse than programs generated by
a compiler written in low-level language. Once the compiler generates
a program the output is (or can be) completely independent of the
compiler.

This post was inspired by a

that Chris Seaton, a compiler researcher, wrote.

The code for major compilers can be scary and low level.
