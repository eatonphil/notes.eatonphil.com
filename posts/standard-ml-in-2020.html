# Standard ML in 2020

Incredibly, Standard ML implementations are still actively
developed. [MLton](http://mlton.org/), [Poly/ML](https://polyml.org),
and [MLKit](https://elsman.com/mlkit/) are the most prominent.
Discussion on the future direction of Standard ML [remains healthy as
well](https://github.com/SMLFamily/Successor-ML/issues).

And somehow OCaml's lesser known cousin still beats out OCaml for
multicore threading support (in Poly/ML).

While MLton hasn't merged with
[MultiMLton](https://github.com/kayceesrk/multiMLton) or
[RTMLton](https://github.com/UBMLtonGroup/RTMLton) to support
multicore, a [new fork of MLton with
parallelism](https://github.com/mpllang/mpl) is pretty far along and
in active development at CMU.

Furthermore, the last few years have welcomed some entirely new
implementations. [WebML](https://github.com/KeenS/webml), by a
prominent open source hacker, is written in Rust and compiles Standard
ML to WebAssembly. [SOSML](https://sosml.org/) is an interpreter
written in TypeScript by former students of Saarland University. It
features [a nifty online IDE](https://sosml.org/editor).

There have also been some new experimental spins on Standard ML in
the last few years. [Morel](https://github.com/julianhyde/morel) is an
interpreter with some nice syntax extensions written in Java by the
author of Apache Calcite. And [Bright
ML](https://github.com/elpinal/bright-ml) is a spin on Standard ML and
OCaml written in Standard ML (and using the abandoned [Moscow
ML](https://mosml.org/) compiler of all implementations).

So if you're looking for an easy intro to the ML family of languages,
I still recommend the simplicity and performance of Standard ML and
its small but definitely, surprisingly, not dead community. :)
