# Why (and how) to read books

The last time I read for fun was in elementary school. Since college I
knew I must read more, but I never forced myself to build the
habit. Then three years ago I spent time around my brother and a
coworker who were avid readers. This "peer pressure" helped me get
started.

Since I started, I've seen concrete improvements in vocabulary. I find
myself using words I didn't know I knew. I question my choice of words
more. And I understand coworkers a little better. Perhaps it is only
personal style, but I've also become more aware of hyperbole in my
speech and have begun to tone that down.

Specifically, books provide more density of information than I can
pull together myself. I've also benefited heavily from reading books
on tools I use daily. Contrary to being boring, a book on a topic with
which I'm familiar has been a (often needed) break from books on
topics with which I am unfamiliar. The former category might include
books on CSS, Bash, Emacs, Python, Scheme, data modeling,
Linux/FreeBSD system administration, mystery novels, and so on. The
latter category might include books on Common Lisp, system
architecture, the implementation of Linux/FreeBSD, behavioral
psychology, management, stock/bond markets, the history of
Argentina/Chile/South Korea/Japan, sci-fi novels, and so on.

Reading diversely exposes how little I know. And that can be
depressing. But I'm fairly confident reading books is the fastest way
to grow.

Tactically speaking, I started slowly with few books and the ones
easiest for me to read. The first year I read two books, both
technical. The second year I read nine books and was able to start
branching out beyond technical books. Last year I read a much more
diverse set of forty books. And this year I followed suit with
forty-one so far (on track for fifty-five or so).

I keep track of books I'm reading and books I want to read in
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/eatonphil). I particularly enjoy
their reading challenge system that lets you know if you are on track
to meet your reading goal for the year.
