# Academic- or industry-born? A programming language survey
## February 8, 2022
###### interpreters,compilers,history,survey

Developers often think of compiler and interpreter development as
being pretty academic, or at least requiring advanced degrees to be
successful. Then again there's a common concept of a language spectrum
from academic (e.g. Scheme, Standard ML, Haskell) to business
(e.g. Python, C++).

So let's take a look at the
[TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) top programming languages
and dig into the background of their creation.

One major caveat in this post is that to keep scope narrower I'll not
go into the post-creation development of the language and
implementation. It's possible that the post-creation development skews
in its own direction academic- or industry-led.

Also, I'm going to be looking into this from public sources so if
there are mistakes please let me know!

### Python: Academic; Master's degree

This is surprising! I just listed Python as "obviously" being more on
the business side of things but it was actually created by van Rossum
(Master's degree) while at a research institute.

### C: Industry; PhD

C was created by Dennis Ritchie (PhD) at Bell Labs. But the
focus on the language was to help build utilities for UNIX and
eventually to rewrite UNIX. UNIX itself was a commercial operating
system, even if it's initial customers were research groups.

### Java: Industry; PhD

Java was created by James Gosling (PhD) at Sun Microsystems.

### C++: Industry; PhD

Started by Bjarne Stroustrup (PhD) at (or just before joining?) Bell
Labs only a decade-ish after C was created at Bell Labs. Good to know
that internal "stack" turmoil is nothing new!

### C#: Industry; no degree

C# was created by Anders Hejlsberg (dropped out of bachelor degree
program) at Microsoft.

### Visual Basic: Industry

Visual Basic was a combination QBasic and a visual editor (originally
called Ruby) by Alan Cooper (associates degree) who sold it to Bill
Gates and Microsoft. But figuring out who built QBasic is harder. It
was built inside of Microsoft in 1991 but other than that I can't seem
to find a lot of information on it.

### JavaScript: Industry; Master's degree

JavaScript was created at Netscape by Brendan Eich (Master's degree).

### PHP: ?; Bachelor's degree

PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf (Bachelor's degree). PHP (meaning
Personal Home Page) was made for personal use, not commercial or
academic.
