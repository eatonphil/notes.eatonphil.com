# Administering Kubernetes is hard

Kubernetes is easy to use after some exposure; it's pretty convenient
too. But it is super hard to set up.

[eksctl](https://eksctl.io) is a good tool for folks who don't want to
spend hours/days/weeks debugging VPC configuration in 1000s of lines
of CloudFormation. None of the other tools seem to be that much easier
to use (kops, kubeadm, etc.).

But even with EKS and eksctl you are constrained to Amazon Linux
worker nodes. AMIs are practically impossible to discover.

I haven't spent much time with GKE.

And while eksctl operates on the right level for developers needing to
administrate small/medium-sized systems, it... doesn't exist outside
EKS.

It is unfortunate the only major container orchestration system is
this complex to administer. The user-facing APIs are pretty solid and
guide toward sustainable system design. It is _really_ hard to see the
value for most companies with medium-sized deployments tasked with
administration. Among serious proprietary alternatives, sure, there's
ECS and Google App Engine. But there's little advantage in existing
Kubernetes user knowledge. The OSS alternatives don't have the
adoption to seem like a good investment.

OpenStack's [magnum](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Magnum) or
OpenShift seem like possible high-level providers for a generic
environment. But neither are particularly known for stability.

In all, the ecosystem has gotten friendlier. There will probably be a
time in the future (3-5 years from now?) when Kubernetes is fairly
easy to administer.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences administering
Kubernetes.
