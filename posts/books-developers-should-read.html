# Four books professional developers should read (and a few you don't need to)
## February 1, 2021
###### books,learning,management

These are the books I recommend to developers wanting to improve their
skills as professional programmers because of high information
density, believable premises/examples, and being well edited.

You don't need to read books to improve as a developer but
they are unparalleled in quickly helping you gain depth in a subject.

### Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python

If you're a Python developer wanting to improve your craft you should
read this. Good Python starts with a deep understanding of the
standard library and language.

### High Performance Browser Networking

If your code is triggered by a desktop or mobile browser you should
read this. It is a thorough high level introduction to mobile
networks, browser network protocols, and fundementals of networking.

### Designing Data-Intensive Applications

If your databases and APIs are a bottleneck you should read this. A
solid introduction to distributed computing, data transfer, indexing,
etc.

### Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Services

If you are responsible for services in production you should read
this. It's Google specific but is an excellent background on practices
for monitoring and maintaining production environments.

### That's it!

Generic software books conspicuously not on this list for
me:

* Clean Code
* JavaScript the Good Parts
* Design Patterns/Gang of Four
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
* A Philosophy of Software Design

They're not all bad but give nowhere near as much return for the
investment of your time.

As always, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:me@eatonphil.com) with
