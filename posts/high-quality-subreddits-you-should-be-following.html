# My favorite software subreddits

If you are an experienced software developer whose only exposure to
reddit is dank memes, [proggit](https://reddit.com/r/proggit) or even
language-specific subreddits like
[/r/python](https://reddit.com/r/python), you're missing out.

What follows are my favorite subreddits in tech. My criteria is that:
* The subreddit topic is relevant to advancing as a programmer
* Posts generally go into good depth
* The comments stay on topic
* And the shit-posting is minimal

This list isn't hard to guess at if you consider advanced topics
in software. But I wanted to share because I think it's worth
explicitly supporting high-quality subreddits.

* [/r/EmuDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/)
  * My favorite sub of all. Also has a [phenomenal Discord group](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/comments/9mop2q/join_the_official_remudev_chat_on_discord/).
* [/r/ProgrammingLanguages](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminglanguages)
  * Focuses a little more on PLT topics (parsing techniques, syntax, type systems) than on compiling and interpreting techniques, but still good.
* [/r/DatabaseDevelopment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DatabaseDevelopment/)
  * Full disclosure: I started this subreddit last week, it's at 400+ members at time of publishing.
* [/r/ReverseEngineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/)
  * The largest subreddit on this list but still has pretty good posts.
* [/r/EsoLangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/esolangs/)
  * One of the best/most fun intros to programming languages/compilers/interpreters is through languages like Brainfuck. This sub does a good job of keeping the fun going.
* [/r/UniKernel](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniKernel/)
  * The smallest on this list but given its size they've done a pretty good job of sharing good posts.
* [/r/GraphicsProgramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/)

### Special mention

These subreddits are on great topics but haven't been maintained
well. They either need new moderators to revitalize them or there
needs to be a good alternative I can point you to.

* [/r/DistributedSystems](https://www.reddit.com/r/DistributedSystems/)

### What am I missing?

Am I missing other amazing subreddits? Just don't say language-specific ones!
