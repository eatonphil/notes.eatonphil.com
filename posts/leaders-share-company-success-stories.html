# Leaders, you need to share organization success stories more frequently
## June 22, 2021

This post goes out to anyone who leads a team: managers, directors,
VPs, executives. You need to share organization success stories with
your organization on a regular and frequent basis. Talk about sales
wins, talk about new services released, talk about the positive impact
of a recent organizational change. Just get in front of your entire
organization and tell them how the organization is making a positive
difference.

Do this at least every other week.

And in case it's not clear, by "success stories" I don't mean bullshit,
or opinions. I mean concrete, measurable things that moved the
organization forward.

Everyone in your organization is contributing to these stories and
it's your job to feed the stories back.

Leaders have a tendency to hear about successes but don't always
remember to propagate the stories down. I've been guilty of this
myself. This post is your (and my own) friendly reminder.

If you don't keep reminding your folks their organization is making a
positive impact, they're going to forget it. You'll miss out on the
freely available chance to give reassurance to your best people.

Talented folks want to be invested in an organization that is
succeeding.
