# Transparency and communication on small teams

I saw a post on
[dev.to](https://dev.to/vcarl/symptoms-of-a-dysfunctional-team-1c0)
that talks about dysfunctional teams. This is a response that focuses
specifically on how to prevent burnout from overworking. This is aimed
at senior/lead engineers and engineering/project managers -- because
everyone in a leadership role is responsible for the health of the
team and the company.

In an otherwise good company with hard-working, ethical employees,
overworking happens because of imperfect communication. If neither of
those premises hold, you have more serious issues and have no need for
this post.

The primary subjects of poor communication are:
* Capacity/capabilities
* Priorities
* Results

If any member of the team (or worse, the entire team) is not honestly
reporting on their capacity and capability, this will drive them to
overwork to make up for what they couldn't accomplish on work hours.

If any member of the team (or worse, the entire team) is not honestly
and publicly reporting on what they understand to be the priorities,
they will end up needing to work overtime if true priorities become
apparent too late.

And if any member of the team (or worse, the entire team) is not
honestly and publicly reporting on what they **accomplished**, they
will end up needing to work overtime if discrepancies become apparent
too late.

### Solution

Put a sprint process in place and schedule **at least** one meeting
every sprint. Discover every political, technical, and structural
stakeholder and find a time they can attend this meeting. At this
meeting you will cover at a high level (perhaps with some demos) what
was accomplished in the sprint and what you intend to accomplish in
the next sprint.

If any stakeholder cannot make this meeting, find a time to sync up
with him/her separately.

Your sprints should not last more than two weeks because any longer is
too long to go before talking to/reviewing with your stakeholders.

Finally, publish a report on what you accomplished this sprint (and
also what you did not accomplish!) and what you plan to accomplish the
next sprint. For example, I send an email to the engineering
organization with two docs at the end of each sprint: 1) a review doc
listing tasks accomplished/not accomplished and 2) a list of tasks
planned for the next sprint. This gives your stakeholders (and anyone
else interested) an opportunity to review the contents of the meeting
at their leisure.

Doing this can be difficult and embarrassing at first. Hard-working,
ethical employees never want to be seen as not accomplishing their
share of work. But the most important thing for the mid-to-long-term
health of these employees is to get them reporting honestly.

This helps make it clear where these employees can legitimately
improve (i.e. receive more training) and where it's necessary to hire
more or different employees. You'll likely need to put pressure on
every team member to report honestly and to do so without fear.

And as a result of doing this, you've done everything you can as a
senior/lead member of a small team to push responsibility for your
team's work up to your stakeholders. This is the best position to be
in.
