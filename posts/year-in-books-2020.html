###### books,reading

This year I finished 47 books, up from last year but not a personal
best. The breakdown was 17 non-fiction and 30 fiction. Another 20-30
remain started but unfinished this year.

### Non-fiction

The 8 non-fiction books I most recommend are:

* [Fashionapolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51034048-fashionopolis) (Must read)
* [Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48566725-effective-python) (Must read; truly excellent for Python programmers, I recommend this to anyone I work with)
* [The Machine that Changed the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93904.The_Machine_That_Changed_the_World) (Must read)
* [Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy from 1453 to the Present](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16043511-europe)
* [Wind, Sand and Stars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19606799-wind-sand-and-stars)
* [American Colussus: The Triumph of Capitalism, 1865-1900](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11169043-american-colossus)
* [Making Common Sense of Japan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2360599.Making_Common_Sense_of_Japan)
* [The German Genius](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8155672-the-german-genius)

The 3 books I recommend you not to waste time on are: "The Two
Koreas", "The Price of Inequality", and "Ninety Percent of Everything:
Inside Shipping".

#### The whole list

* [The Two Koreas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/235560.The_Two_Koreas) by Don Oberdorfer
  * Interesting but not a huge fan, seemed pretty biased against South Korea somehow
* [Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88546.Forbidden_Nation) by Jonathan Manthorpe
* [Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48566725-effective-python) by Brett Slatkin
* [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43701534-a-philosophy-of-software-design) by John Ousterhout
  * Came as a recommendation from someone on Twitter, ultimately not a huge fan. Still looking for high quality books on software design
* [The Price of Inequality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16031130-the-price-of-inequality) by Joseph E. Stiglitz
  * Agreed with the premise but the book was incoherent and too self-assuring
* [Paris Reborn: Napoléon III, Baron Haussmann, and the Quest to Build a Modern City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18930203-paris-reborn) by Stephane Kirkland
* [Fashionapolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51034048-fashionopolis) by Dana Thomas
* [A Moveable Feast](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6603103-a-moveable-feast) by Ernest Hemingway
  * I normally love Hemingway's writing but this particular book was not very coherent
* [Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy from 1453 to the Present](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16043511-europe) by Brendan Simms
  * Such an excellent introduction to the continent for Americans who otherwise don't have great background
* [Wind, Sand and Stars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19606799-wind-sand-and-stars) by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
  * A beautiful memoir of flights by the author of The Little Prince, very similar in style to Hemingway
* [American Colussus: The Triumph of Capitalism, 1865-1900](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11169043-american-colossus) by H.W. Brands
  * Baby's first primer on unions, (I need more recommendations on the history of unions)
* [Making Common Sense of Japan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2360599.Making_Common_Sense_of_Japan) by Steven R. Reed
  * It can be difficult to find English translations of Korean, Japanese history by Korean and Japanese authors; this is a good one by an American professor
* [The Machine that Changed the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93904.The_Machine_That_Changed_the_World) by James P. Womack
  * An excellent, well-researched history of automobile manufacturing in the US, Europe and Japan from the 1900s to 1990; how Japan ate everyone's lunch
* [The United States of Europe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40620.The_United_States_of_Europe) by T.R. Reid
  * Very light introduction to the European Union
* [The Soul of a New Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090.The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine) by Tracy Kidder
  * Overhyped by the internets, but not bad
* [The German Genius](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8155672-the-german-genius) by Peter Watson
  * Dense but excellent introduction to many famous Germans in many fields throughout time
* [Ninety Percent of Everything: Inside Shipping](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18626537-ninety-percent-of-everything) by Rose George
