# Parser generators vs. handwritten parsers: surveying major language implementations in 2021

Developers often think parser generators are the sole legit way to
build programming language frontends, possibly because compiler
courses in university teach lex/yacc variants. But do any modern
programming languages actually use parser generators anymore?

To find out, this post presents a non-definitive survey of the parsing
techniques used by various major programming language implementations.

### CPython: PEG parser

Until CPython 3.10 (which hasn't been released yet) the default parser
was built using [pgen](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0269/), a
custom parser generator. The team thought the PEG parser was a [better
fit for expressing the
language](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0617/). At the time the
switch from pgen to PEG parser improved speed 10% but increased memory
usage by 10% as well.

The PEG grammar is defined
[here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.6/Grammar/python.gram). (It
is getting renamed in 3.10 though so check the directory for a file of
a similar name if you browse 3.10+).

  I mistakenly claimed the previous parser was
  handwritten. It was not.

### GCC: Handwritten

Source code for the C parser available
[here](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/c/c-parser.c). It
used to use Bison until [GCC 4.1 in 2006](The old Bison-based C and
Objective-C parser has been replaced by a new, faster hand-written
recursive-descent parser.  ). The C++ parser also switched from Bison
to a handwritten parser [2 years
earlier](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/changes.html).

### Clang: Handwritten

Not only handwritten but the same _file_ handles parsing C,
Objective-C and C++. Source code is available
[here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-12.0.1/clang/lib/Parse/Parser.cpp).

### Ruby: Yacc-like Parser Generator

Ruby uses Bison (thanks for the
[correction](https://twitter.com/kddnewton/status/1430912896473739271)!). The
grammar for the language can be found
[here](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v3_0_2/parse.y).

### V8 JavaScript: Handwritten

Source code available [here](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/9.5.38/src/parsing/parser.cc).

### Zend Engine PHP: Yacc-like Parser Generator

Source code available [here](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-8.0.9/Zend/zend_language_parser.y).

### TypeScript: Handwritten

Source code available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/v4.3.5/src/compiler/parser.ts).

### Bash: Yacc-like Parser Generator

Source code for the grammar is available
[here](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/parse.y?h=bash-5.1).

### Chromium CSS Parser: Handwritten

Source code available [here](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/95.0.4617.2/third_party/blink/renderer/core/css/parser/css_parser_impl.cc).

### Java (OpenJDK): Handwritten

You can find the source code
[here](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/jdk-18%2B11/src/jdk.compiler/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javac/parser/JavacParser.java).

Some [older
commentary](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/compiler-grammar/) calls
this implementation fragile. But a Java contributor [suggests the
situation has improved since Java
8](https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/status/1429227723055042568).

### Golang: Handwritten

Until Go 1.6 the compiler used a yacc-based parser. The source code
for that grammar is available
[here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.5/src/cmd/compile/internal/gc/y.go).

In Go 1.6 they switched to a handwritten parser. You can find that
change [here](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/16665/). There
was a reported 18% speed increase when parsing files and a reported 3%
speed increase in building the compiler itself when switching.

You can find the source code for the compiler's parser
[here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.17/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/parser.go).

### Roslyn: Handwritten

The C# parser source code is available
[here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/Visual-Studio-2019-Version-16.11/src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/Parser/LanguageParser.cs). The
Visual Basic parser source code is
[here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/Visual-Studio-2019-Version-16.11/src/Compilers/VisualBasic/Portable/Parser/Parser.vb).

A C# contributor mentioned a few key reasons for using a handwritten parser [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13915150).

### Lua: Handwritten

Source code available [here](https://github.com/lua/lua/blob/v5.4.3/lparser.c).

### Swift: Handwritten

Source code available [here](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/swift-5.4.2-RELEASE/lib/Parse/Parser.cpp).

### R: Yacc-like Parser Generator

I couldn't find it at first but
[Liorithiel](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/p8vv1l/parser_generators_vs_handwritten_parsers/h9tl763/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
showed me the parser source code is
[here](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/gram.y).

### Julia: Handwritten ... in Scheme

Julia's parser is handwritten but not in Julia. It's in Scheme! Source code available [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/v1.6.2/src/julia-parser.scm).

### PostgreSQL: Yacc-like Parser Generator

PostgreSQL uses Bison for parsing queries. Source code for the grammar
available
[here](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_13_STABLE/src/backend/parser/gram.y).

### MySQL: Yacc Parser Generator

Source code for the grammar available
[here](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/8.0/sql/sql_yacc.yy).

### SQLite: Yacc-like Parser Generator

SQLite uses its own parser generator called
[Lemon](https://www.sqlite.org/lemon.html). Source code for the
grammary is available
[here](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/version-3.36.0/src/parse.y).

### Summary

Of the [2021 Redmonk top 10
languages](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2021/03/01/language-rankings-1-21/),
8 of them have a handwritten parser. Ruby and Python use parser generators.

Although parser generators are still used in major language
implementations, maybe it's time for universities to start teaching
handwritten parsing?

  This tweet was published before I was corrected about Python's
  parser. It should say 8/10 but I cannot edit the tweet.
